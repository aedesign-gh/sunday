It took another thirty minutes for our continuation with our one on one talk with Cabinet Sec. Jun Evasco in Sikatuna town the other Saturday night while attending the grand reunion of the alumni of the Sikatuna Central Elementary School (SCES).

After discussing the gubernatorial race in 2018, Evasco reminded us of our unsuccessful run for board member in 2010.

At that time, Evasco was running for his third and final term as town mayor of Maribojoc. Most of the time that a caucus was held in his town in May 2010, Evasco joined our campaign team led by former Vice Gov. Julius F. Herrera for governor and his running mate, Board Member Tomas D. Abapo Jr.

We also mentioned to him about Herrera who has been floated by the Duterte supports in Bohol to run for a post next year. Evasco said he has not personally meet Herrera yet to know his political plans.

Our conversation was sparked by the observation of one of the staff of the cabinet secretary after he heard us speak during the reunion together with Donald Sevilla, who also made an unsuccessful run as a board member in 2016.

The staff said “is this in preparation for the local elections next year?” nobody gave him a definite answer.

In the midst of our discussion, Evasco mentioned that former City Mayor Dan Neri Lim rode with him in his flight from Manila to Tagbilaran on that day.

We were quite curious on the political plans of the former city mayor but Evasco plainly said that Lim was already contented with the mandate that he got from the Tagbilaranons who voted him for city mayor for three consecutive terms.

It is on this regard that Evasco noted the possibility that somebody may challenge City Mayor Baba Yap in 2019 and cited a former city official who has occupied a post in the judiciary.

This political figure may get the support of a city businessman who has an axe to grind with the present city hall dispensation. Incidentally, this businessman sold a real property in Panglao town worth P1.2 billion. 

Listen, its billion not million and the businessman is eager to spend P2 billion as campaign kitty of the purported city mayoralty bet next year.

This has caught our attention definitely. No, it is not on the city mayoralty bet but on the P2 billion set aside by the businessman. Our eyes sparkled with the peso sign when we heard this development right from a Malacanang official.

Well, while we wanted to extend our time with the Cabinet Secretary but our editorial staff already called out attention as the final layout of this paper needs our approval as the press deadline is drawing near.

More on our future one on one talk with Cabinet Sec. Jun Evasco as continue to make his presence felt in every nook and corner of the province.
