Cabinet Sec. Jun Evasco: 
up, close and personal (Part I)

We motored to the town of Sikatuna last night upon the invitation of former Mayor Constancio “Tanny” Rule.

The affair was the grand re-union of the Sikatunas Central Elementary School (SCES) which is part of the pre-fiesta activities of the town.

Cabinet Sec. Leoncio B. Evasco Jr. was the guest of honor during the affair. He was accompanied by former Mayor Leon Calipusan of Loboc who was bruited around as one of the congressional timbers in the third district.

Former Board Member Billy Tongco represented Gov. Edgar M. Chatto during the affair. Mayor Jose Ellorimo joined us in the table together with Donald Sevilla and his wife.

We were invited by Evasco to sit with him in the table and we spent two hours talking with each other tete-a-tete.

We talked a lot of things for two hours despite the noise of a live band and the program of the participants led by Atty. DindoPalgan.

Our conversation was sparked with our meeting with our kumpadre, Chito Fuentes at the Island City Mall recently where we stood for almost an hour near the elevator just to update on issues we both are interested most.

We have been friends with Evasco while he was still the town mayor of Maribojoc while we were also serving our term as city councillor of Tagbilaran.

One thing we got from him is that former City Mayor Dan Lim, whom he rode on the plane from Manila to Tagbilaran that day, has been thankful for the opportunity to serve as the city mayor of Tagbilaranons.

Now we go straight to the topic wherein our dead readers are interested most, the reported gubernatorial plan of Evasco next year.

Being the man of the President in Bohol, Evasco can stand by his own even without the backing of anybody in his gubernatorial bid.

This means that he can run by his own without fielding any candidate in the congressional, provincial sanggunian, municipal mayor or even his running mate.

But Evasco told us that the governorship is a matter of destiny. “If it’s yours, it’s gonna be yours”, he said.

However, the Cabinet Secretary was more interested about the politics in Tagbilaranespecially that there is a potential challenger against City Mayor Baba Yap on his third and final term.

At our conversation was temporarily interrupted when we were given the time to speak before the participants of the grand reunion by the program emcees, ArdyBatoy and former Mayor Tanny Rule.

When we go back to our chair, we resumed our one on one talk with Evasco. More on that in the next issue. (To be continued)
