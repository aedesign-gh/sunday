On traffic violators

We drove towards the town of Tubigon last Sunday morning when before we reached its town proper there were so many motorcycles parked on both sides of the road. I wonder what it was all about when I knew there was no cockpit nearby. A few hundred meters away was a check point where policemenin uniform wereflagging down motorists who did not wear helmet.

The officers set up their check points at strategic places in a locality. Usually they stayed at a bend where an unsuspecting driver could not make a sudden U Turn when they found a check point.  And the penalty depends on the arresting officers.

Province-wide these days, policemen give teeth to the national law stipulating that motorcycle drivers and their backriders must wear the prescribe helmet. They reinforced the undermanned highway patrol group of the Land Transportation Office (LTO). And violators are a plenty, too many to handle by the government officials.

Check points are targeting three kinds of traffic violations.  A flagged down motorists are asked to produce the registration of his motorcycle; his updated driving  license and  the safety  helmet.

There are many reasons why these motorists violated the law. One of the reasons why drivers do not renew their licenses and the registration of their vehicles is the time consumed at the LTO. The slow pace of the transactions, the many unnecessary requirements and the ever alleged present red tapes are also one of the reasons. And LTO officials have not seen these problems.

Barangay officials should be tapped to check and monitor on the driverâ€™s licenses and the registrations of vehicles within their jurisdiction. They will be given LTO forms for registration with the corresponding payments. Of course the barangay could have their share of the registration fees as one of their source for their revenue. Technocrats should study this kind of system to minimize congestion at the LTO.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: There is no man-made law that is perfect.
