The disobedience of the old family and the obedience of the new family

10th Sunday of the Year(cycle B)
Readings:	Gen3:9-15; 2 Cor4:13-5:1; Mk3:20-35

Sometimes if we are caught doing something wrong, the tendency is to point at somebody or to look for somebody to blame so that we can justify why we did such a thing.  This has been the tendency of man since the beginning.  We heard in our first reading from the book of Genesis that God found out what Adam and Eve did.  Adam blamed Eve and then Eve blamed the serpent.

Our point of reflection here is not about blame shifting. We will be reflecting on the root cause and the consequences of the sin of the first children of God and how Jesus wanted to restore God’s family.

When God put Adam and Eve in the paradise, He clearly instructed them never to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  However, after being deceived by the evil one, they disobeyed God’s command.  This was the first sin of mankind – disobedience.

This disobedience brought disorder.  Creation was already good and in order until man disobeyed God’s order and thus came disorder, conflict, and disharmony.

As to the case of man, he was considered to be the crown of creation.  As the Psalms would say: “What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?  Yet you have made him a little lower than the angels and crowned him with glory and honor.  You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet.”  How great is the privilege of man.  He is not just a mere creature of God but considered to part of God’s family in paradise.However man’s disobedience casts himself out of paradise, out from God’s family.  Sin hinders man to become part of God’s family.

Jesus Christ intends to restore man back to God’s family.  In our Gospel, we heard that the family of Jesus was looking for him.  When informed about them, Jesus said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”  And looking around he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.  For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”

Here we learn that obedience to the will of God restores us the privilege of being His children through His Son Jesus Christ.  One of the conditions of true kinship is common obedience as William Barclay would say: “True kinship lies in a common obedience. The disciples were a very mixed group. All kinds of beliefs and opinions were mixed up among them. A tax-collector like Matthew and a fanatical nationalist like Simon the Zealot ought to have hated each other like poison and no doubt at one time did. But they were bound together because both had accepted Jesus Christ as Master and Lord. Any platoon of soldiers will be made up of men from different backgrounds and from different walks of life and holding very different opinions; yet, if they are long enough together, they will be welded into a band of comrades because of the common obedience which they all share. Men can become friends of each other when they share a common master. Men can love each other only when they all love Jesus Christ.”  By obedience, harmony in creation will also be restored.

We always hear of the saying “Blood is thicker than water.”  It means that whatever will happen, it is the interest or sympathy of those having the blood ties will prevail.  In other words, the blood of the family prevails.  But this is not the case on God’s family.  It is not solely a matter of flesh and blood.  It is about obedience to the will of the Heavenly Father which is thicker than blood.
