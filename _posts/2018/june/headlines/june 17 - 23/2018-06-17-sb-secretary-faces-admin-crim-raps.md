SB secretary faces admin-crim raps

A Sangguniang Bayan secretary is now facing administrative and criminal complaints filed at the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas for allegedly causing the publication of a municipal ordinance without the benefit of a public bidding or undergoing any mode of government procurement as provided by law.

Edgar Villafuerte of the Sangguniang Bayan of Candijay town is accused of violating R.A. 9184, known as the Government Procurement Reformed Act and R.A 3019 Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Sec. 3 (e), (g), which define the following acts a crime: “giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, preference”, and “entering, on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same, whether or not the public officer profited or will profit thereby.”

Administrative complaints of Grave Misconduct, Dishonesty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service were also filed against Villafuerte seeking his dismissal from service, forfeiture of benefits, cancellation of his civil service eligibility and perpetual disqualification from re-employment in government service.
The complaints were filed by print-broadcast journalist Fred C. Amora, who is currently a news correspondent of this paper.

In his complaint, Amora alleged that Villafuerte gave undue favor to a local newspaper for the publication of two municipal ordinances of Candijay; Municipal Ordinance No. 13, S. 2017, “Revised Revenue Code of Candijay, Bohol” and Municipal Ordinance No. 11, S. 2017 “Usage of LED Screen”, without the benefit of a public bidding or any mode of procurement as provided by R.A. 9184 otherwise known as the “Government Procurement Reformed Act”.

The said publication was not also posted for Invitation to Bid in the website Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGeps) as required by R.A. 9184, the government procurement law. 

The total amount of the publication was estimated to cost P420,000 as the ordinances were printed in 84 pages for three consecutive weeks at P5,000 per page.

Amora positively pointed to Villafuerte as the one who caused the publication of the aforementioned municipal ordinances since those documents are in his custody, and he alone has the complete SOFT File (digital copy) of said ordinances saved in a computer, protected with a password and none of his SB staff can release them without his approval.

The managing editor of the local newspaper where the ordinances were published was also included in the criminal complaint for allegedly helping Villafuerte and willfully making possible the illegal printing of the ordinances.

Amora said as managing editor, respondent possessed the controlling power of the paper. 

But despite full knowledge that the newspaper has not been given yet any award or contract from the Bids, Awards Committee (BAC) of the Municipality of Candijay, Bohol the ordinances were published through the intercession of the managing editor.

Villafuerte and the managing editor’s collusionshowed clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of established rules;and for Villafuerte, in wrongfully using hisofficial position as Secretary to the Sangguniang Bayan,with the intention togain benefits for the two of them, contrary to rights of others,” Amora alleged in his complaint.

Reports said SB secretaries allegedly receive hefty “commission” of about 30% from the total cost of municipal ordinance publications and said corrupt practices reportedly still continue despite government’s present day campaign against graft and corruption.
Sometime in November 2017, Amora visited the office of Villafuerte wherein the latter made assurance that if there is ordinance for publication, the Invitation to Bid will be posted at the government procurement website PhilGeps, or other newspapers will be notified.

Bohol has six newspapers including the Bohol Chronicle, Bohol Times, Bohol Tribune, Bohol Balita Daily News, Bohol News Today and this paper.

“To our surprise, on December 17, 2017, we saw in the pages of one of the newspapers, the publication of Municipal Ordinance No. 13, S. 2017, “Revised Revenue Code of Candijay, Bohol” and Municipal Ordinance No. 11, S. 2017 “Usage of LED Screen”.

“That on the following day, we visited the Office of the BAC chairman Ms. Josephine T. Manlupig, of LGU-Candijay, Bohol who denied knowledge of any bidding or award for publication of said two ordinances.

Villafuerte’s act of transacting with one favored entity, skipping procurement rules, deprived other newspapers the equal opportunity to participate in a public or competitive bidding, - an act grossly disadvantageous to the government, the complaint said.

Documents obtained by this paper indicated that the twin administrative and criminal complaints were officially received by the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas lastJune 4.
