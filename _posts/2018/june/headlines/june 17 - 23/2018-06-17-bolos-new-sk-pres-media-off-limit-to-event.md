The ugly head of politics soared as the Sangguniang Kabataan held its provincial officers last week even as the opposition was caught with its pants down in the quick election.

The SK provincial president also sits as an ex-oficio member of the Sangguniang Panglalawigan of Bohol. 

Christian Victor S. Bolos III of Dauis town was elected unopposed as SK provincial president after a hiatus during the election held last week at Bohol Cultral Center but criticized by media for it was done off limits.

The federation composed of SK town federation presidents of 47 towns and this city also elected John G. Labajo, vice-president; Bernalyn B. Centino, secretary; Aileen V. Pabonita, treasurer; and Tom Cesar V. Vergara, auditor.

There are three public relations officers (PRO) and sergeant-at-arms and Board of directors representing three congressional districts.

John Kenneth Lao, Paul Dexter A. Lim and Archie M. Casanova are the PROs; and Lou Brian L. Taray, April Joseph Corciega and Sam Joseph Barril, sgt-at-arms.

Board of directors are Kurt Henry III Calipusan (first dist), June Reigh Reyes (2nd dist) and Cesyl L. Balahay (3rd).

Meanwhile, most media personalities supposedly covering the event were barred from entering the BCC premises since it was off limits to media.

Why media are banned from covering the said election is still the same regulations since its last elections five years ago is something not transparent, said one mediaman who declined to be named.

Apparently the opposition was caught off-guarded in the SK provincial federation election last week.

The SK position in the provincial board is considered by many as crucial especially with the political positioning for the next political exercise.

For his part, Gov. Edgar Chatto challenged Bolos and his fellow young leaders, telling them “there is much more in youth leadership than sports and social events.”
Among his priorities, the new 21-year-old SK provincial head will legislate for the significant reduction of school dropouts province-wide. 

Bolos led the SK-Bohol officials in taking their oath before Chatto, himself a former provincial youth leader, right after their election at the Bohol Cultural Center on Wednesday.

The election was facilitated by the provincial Department of Interior and Local Government with the support of the Commission on Elections and Liga ng mga Barangay, among others.

Dauis Mayor Marietta Sumaylo congratulated Bolos, who is the first municipal SK president of Dauis---and first from a First District town---to head the provincial federation.

The governor recalled in his message to the SK that he was “in the same woods before when I was about your age.”

Chatto had headed in Bohol the then Kabataang Barangay (KB), which gave nativity to his public governance and career with not just exciting opportunities but a lot of challenges, too, 

“Don’t look only at each tree, but also the whole forest, so you will have a helicopter’s orientation: Not too low to see only the trees, not too high to see only the forest,” he said.

But as a forest has precious floras and faunas, so does it have beasts and serpents, reminded the governor who is a government service institution and a seasoned politician. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio and Ven rebo Arigo)
