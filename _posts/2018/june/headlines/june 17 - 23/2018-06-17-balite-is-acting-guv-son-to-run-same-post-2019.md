Vice Gov. Dionisio D. Balite assumed as acting governor of the province starting last Friday after Gov. Edgar M. Chato left for the United States.

Balite will continue to act as acting governor until June 24 when Chatto returns from his trip abroad.

In his letter to Balite, Chatto said he will be attending the wedding of his niece, Dr. Judith Marie B. Chatto, daughter of his elder brother, Dr.Eladio M. Chatto Jr.
The trip of the governor abroad came at a time that reports regarding his state of health if circulating like wildfire here.

Reports said the governor has been hospitalized twice in the past couple of weeks. The first one was at St. Lukes Hospital in Manila when he was brought their through an air ambulance.

This was followed by reports of Chattoâ€™s confinement at a Cebu City hospital the other week due to his heart problems.

Meanwhile, reports from the Capitol said that Board Member Victor Dionisio A. Balite is reportedly running for vice-governor next year, the same position held by his father, the incumbent vice-governor.

Reports said the elder Balite is running for congressman in the third district which will be vacated by Cong. Arthur C. Yap who is on his third and final term as congressman.

The young Balite will be capitalizing on the name recall of his father when will run for vice-governor next year.
