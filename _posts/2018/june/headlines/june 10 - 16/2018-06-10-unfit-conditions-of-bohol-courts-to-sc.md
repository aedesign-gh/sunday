The unfit condition of courts in Bohol and the proposed new Hall of Justice were being raised to the Supreme Court by Gov. Edgar M. Chatto, himself a lawyer.

Even the judges have complained over the limited spaces of the regional trial courts (RTCs), lack of record stockrooms, and deteriorating facilities inside the existing old, ill-equipped justice hall.  
Chatto told Court Administrator Jose Midas Marquez of the willingness of the provincial government to house temporarily the affected courts in the new capitol annex building in Dao.

This is while a sufficient fund for the costly new justice hall is yet to be allocated and the concrete implementation of the project started until fully completed, which can yet take some years.
Once the courts are relocated temporarily, the vacated hall of justice will be rehabilitated by the provincial government for use by some capitol offices, the governor said.

This will bring all provincial government offices to one area since the old justice hall is just beside the imposing new capitol building, which is set for inauguration in the third week of July. 
Chatto and Midas talked when the governor and his wife, Balilihan Mayor Pureza Veloso-Chatto, escorted their new lawyer child, Esther Patrisha, to the SC for roll signing in the book of lawyers last Wednesday.

Midas assured of immediate action as Chatto sought, through the court administrator, help from the SC office supervising the judicial facilities in the country.

The governor sought SC guidance and approval of the temporary transfer of the existing hall of justice occupants, including the prosecution offices, to the soon-finished new capitol annex building. 

The building is near the BMCI where other capitol annex buildings are currently occupied by the offices of the provincial health, agriculture and veterinarian, as well as Commission on Elections.   
For their administrative operation, the said offices will in turn be transferred to the rehabilitated justice hall to be near and in one location with the new provincial capitol.

Chatto and Midas also discussed the execution of a memorandum of agreement or any legal instrument allowing the province to rehabilitate the dilapidated justice hall for use by some capitol offices.
The RTCs and prosecution offices will be permanently relocated to the wholly new hall of justice once the latter is built probably in Cabawan, this city.

The SC administrator assured the governor of necessary guidance to what next steps to take formalizing the pertinent agreement or executing the appropriate legal instrument.

Both Chato and Midas are hopeful that the arrangement will mutually benefit the officials, employees and clients of the judicial department and provincial government.

Although it may take some years to fully complete, the new hall of justice will house all the seven RTCs situated in the city, including those renting a private building and located behind a cemetery.
There are four other RTC salas located outside Tagbilaran City, strategically in Loay, Carmen and Talibon.

The possible site of the justice hall in Cabawan was mentioned during the first-ever joint session of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and Sangguniang Panlungsod at the city hall last May 4.

The historic session was led by Provincial Board Member Venzencio Arcamo, who was then the acting vice governor, and City Vice Mayor Jose Antonio Veloso.

It was attended no less by Chatto, City Mayor John Gessnell Yap II and First District Rep. Rene Relampagos who participated in the discussion.

The new hall of justice project has been endorsed by the provincial and regional development councils for national funding.  

This is separate and distinct from a Relampagos proposal in Congress to create additional RTCs which will be located in Tubigon. (Ven rebo Arigo)
