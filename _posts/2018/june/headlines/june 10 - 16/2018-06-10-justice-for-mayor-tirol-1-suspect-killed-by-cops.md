Mayor Tirol was interred Wednesday afternoon in a town cemetery with a throng of people here, including barangay officials and some municipal mayors of other towns in attendance.

While his family, relatives and the municipal officials wanted that justice be served to Mayor Tirol, one of the suspects was killed in barangay Concepcion, Danao, an adjacent town here last Wednesday dawn.

The slain suspect was identified as one EmigdioAparece, 22, who was killed by police operatives on the same day of the mayor’s burial.

She admitted however that policemen are disallowed to enter cockpits, “yet their presence within the prescribed distance outside the cockpit arena, could help in maintaining peace and order in the area where cockfighting is going on.”

Gementiza also urged for police visibility during Sunday masses and in school zones since regular school classes began.
