This early three potential contenders are already showing interest and even make their presence felt in some social gatherings in third congressional district that comprises 19 towns.

But an insider in the camp of Rep. Arthur C. Yap said the third-termer solon will also field his own candidate in the congressional race making the race into a four-cornered fight.

Reports said Yap will endorse a former judge in the third district as his replacement.

Early this year, former Carmen Mayor Conchita “Che” Toribiodelos Reyes has been reported to be eyeing a comeback in his congressional bid in the district. 

In her recent interviews, she hinted that she is throwing her hat, again, in the congressional election of the district, where her town belongs.

Her interest to gun for congress was boosted considering that Yap is on his last term in 2019, that makes levelling the field.

Delos Reyes, who supported then Vice-Pres. JejomarBinay for president did not make it against Yap in 2016.

Another contender is former Loboc Mayor Leon Calipusan who filed his certificate of candidacy in 2016 but later on withdrew making Yap as the lone candidate for congressman in the third district.

Reports said money changed hands in the course of the third district congressional race. 

Though Calipusandid not make any political statement for 2019 elections, his body language signifies otherwise.

Calipusan has been and still is accompanying Cabinet Sec. LeocioEvasco wherever and whenever the latter is present in any form of social gathering and speaking engagement.

It was not immediately known whether Calipusanwants some sort of a blessing from Evasco.

Calipusan is still a member of Liberal Party, according to the column ‘ShortCuts’ in Bohol Times written by Alma Bella B. Diputado, better-half of Atty. Salvador Diputado, regional director of Department of Agriculture in Region 7. 

Another wanna-be is incumbent Vice-Gov. Dionisio D. Balitewho “is also interested to run,” according to his daughter Alma Bella BaliteDiputado in the same column.

Balite is now the designated head of the chaotic PartidoDemokratiko Pilipino-Lakasngbayan (PDP-Laban) who supported the Davao City Mayor DigongDuterteinhis presidential campaign in 2016.

Alma Diputadoadded in her column that “in that fateful event right in the house of ChecheToribio in Carmen, Bohol, he and his son (my brother) Victor Balite were the only ones in the opposition to insist in supporting DigongDuterte.”

Meanwhile, Yap who is now allied with PDP-Laban is eyeing for the vice-gubernatorial post with Cong. Rene L. Relampagos of the diminishing Liberal Party (LP) as his candidate for governor next year.
