On Tuesday, the country will mark the 120th Philippine Independence Day and Filipinos are mandated to publicly display the Philippine flag at their residence, business firms and in their vehicles and even motorcycles.

This will show our patriotism – love of country and to be proud as Filipinos.

Without further ado, we noticed that the display of Philippine flags in the city is wanting.

Historically, the Philippine Independence Day falls on July 4, the way when the Americans declared independence to the Philippines on the same day that they marked their Thanksgiving Day, their own Independence Day from the hands of the British government.

So it’s rather queer to have July 2 as our Independence Day when the United States also had theirs.
Pres. DiosdadoMacapagal, father of former Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, realized the confusion and ordered the transfer of our Independence Day to June 12, the day when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo declared our independence from the hands of the Spanish tormentors in Kawit, Cavite.

July 4 is now the Philippine-American Friendship Day.

So, historically speaking, our Independence Day celebration is quite confusing as to the millennial Filipinos.

When we celebrate our Independence Day today, we no longer have the same passion being felt by Andres Bonifacio when he cried in Pugadlawin shouting “Viva del independencia del Filipina!”

In wanting to display the Philippine flag in our house, firms and vehicles, it is not necessarily a question of our being independent.

It is more of the lack of passion to realize the very virtue of independence from our foreign tormentors who even intervened how we run our human rights issue in our country.
