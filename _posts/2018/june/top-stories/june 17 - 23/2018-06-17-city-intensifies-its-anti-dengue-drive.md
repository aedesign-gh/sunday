City intensifies its 
anti-dengue drive

The City Health Office (CHO) was in full force during the search and destroy campaign in the barangays which kicked off last week, June being declared as the Dengue Awareness Month.

Dr.JeiaPondoc, city health officer, together with the City Epidemiologist Surveillance Unit (CESU) Head Cristopher SergitoUyled a team to scour the 15 barangays in the identification and destruction of breeding sites. 

After which a series of lectures were conducted among the newly-elected SK chairman and members about the preventive measures which should be spearheaded to counter the disease.

It should be remembered that Tagbilaran City was successful in its anti-dengue efforts.

Pondoc reported that from 2014, dengue cases from all the 15 barangays in Tagbilaran City totaled to 552, it increased to 607 in 2015, and slightly went down in 2016 with 441 cases. 

In 2017, it went to an all-time low of only 95 cases. It also registered a zero-death casualty in dengue. 

City Mayor Baba Yap was elated with this meaningful accomplishment. 

Uysaid the efforts were also strengthened by the City Ordinance 238 sponsored by City Councilor DulceGlovasawhich institutionalized the creation of the Anti-Dengue Campaign Task Force which rallied the cause of preventing the spread of the disease.

“The ordinance mandated the creation of the kontra-dengue task force in every barangay. It strongly complemented our work, supported our efforts to promote the 4S, which is done by conducting lectures. It is also during the lectures where we emphasized self-protective measures like wearing long sleeves and jogging pants”, explained Uy. 

Aside from the lectures, the team also provided early consultation. Further, the team annually conducts barangay surveillance wherein larvicide is scattered to an identified breeding site.

Uy is also thankful to the financial support given by Mayor Yap to the CHO’s anti-dengue programs. 

In the past years, the CHO records showed that dengue has been singled out as one of the major causes of deaths in the city.

But to date, due to the success of the kontra-dengue programs of the city government, the deadly dengue disease has already been removed from the list.
