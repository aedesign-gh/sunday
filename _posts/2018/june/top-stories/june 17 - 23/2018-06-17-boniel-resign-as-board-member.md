Board Member Nino ReyBoniel formally tendered his resignation as member of the SangguniangPanlalawigan in a letter sent to Vice Gov. Dionisio D. Balite last week.
The resignation created a vacancy in the provincial board representing one seat in the second district.

“My tenure maybe short but I have so many to be grateful for especially the assistance of my SP family in my capacity as public official,” he said.

His letter of resignation read before the SP session last week was furnished to DILG thru provincial director Ma. LoisellaLucino.

Meanwhile, a sister of Bonielis expected to replace him after he tendered his irrevocable resignation effective June 7.

Vierna Mae BonielMaglasang, who is currently the legislative staff assistant of Boniel’s office, is preparing for her papers for submission to the Office of the President to appointment her as replacement to her brother, according to her relative.

She has already taken her oath as member of the Nacionalista Party before then Senator’s Bongbong Marcos when the latter visited Bohol lately.

It was learned that political affiliation is said to be prime consideration as practice for replacement of vacant position in elective posts.

The President of the Republic is the one to appoint someone to any vacancy in the provincial elective posts.

In resigning from his post, Boniel cited no specific reason why he called it quits even after what he called consultation with his family and supporters.

He is behind bars in Cebu City for the allegation that he killed his wife, former Mayor Gisela BendongBoniel.

Boniel said he expressed gratitude for serving the provincial board even for a short time. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
