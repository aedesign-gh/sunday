Miss Bohol 2018 bets in
Kita ugangGobernador

Miss Bohol 2018 candidates' presentation during the regular Friday morning conversation of Gov. Edgar Chatto with the media at the Governor's Mansion. 
This batch could have the most number of smart minds, according to some observers. 
Here are some interesting facts: Miss Sikatuna is learning aviation at the Indiana Aerospace University; Miss Bilar takes up petroleum engineering; Miss Jagna is a tourism magna cum laude at the University of San Carlos; Miss Maribojoc is a registered nurse and a flight attendant of both domestic & International flights of Cebu Pacific; and Miss Dimiao, probably the youngest, is yet in Grade 11.
