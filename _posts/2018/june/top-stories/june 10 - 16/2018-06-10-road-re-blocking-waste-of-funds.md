Board Member Tomas D, Abapo, Jr. last week lashed at the re-blocking in many segments of national road in the province being undertaken by different contractors and supervised by DPWH, saying it is a “waste of funds.”

The road re-blocking and delay in completion of bridge projects have triggered a public uproar being feasted in social media.

Abapo has expressed his disgust over the situation of said projects that apparently is causing loss of funds, aside from too much delay, in his privilege speech on Friday during the session presided over by Vice-Gov. Dionisio D. Balite.

The delays in completion of roads and bridges, like those in MakapikoRiver in Batuan and in barangay Hinawanan and Palo, Loay town which he earlier exposed, have caused too much confusion and inconvenience of the motorists and riding public in general.

These (delays) have been admitted by DPWH consultant Engr. Masatoshi Kawahara in the project implementation, the public works committee report rendered by its chair Board Member Ricky Masamayor showed.

Abapo minced no words of saying that some roads being re-blocked as a result of the 2013 earthquake are still serviceable.

He immediately moved for the passage of a Resolution (approved en masse), earnestly requesting the Governor’s office to make representation to DPWH thru Sec. Mark Villar to revisit or review their findings in some roads that needs re-blocking.

He lamented that just because they (DPWH) have a lot of funds they’re already implementing the project while other roads or road shoulders remain not having asphalted or concreted yet.

He firmly believed that there’s not much road to be re-blocked but still usable that may have save funds for use in other roads not cemented yet.

As this developed, in what Abapo described as destruction, apparently referring to “punching” of concrete highways along the towns of Ubay, Getafe and the interior part between Catigbian and Tubigon towns and the one located in barangay Buenavista between Dagohoy and Carmen towns are already done.
Meanwhile, Masamayor reported that Kawahara reasoned out why the delays in bridge projects.

He said that the delays were caused by technical problem, “designs for bridge approaches need new and high technology to prevent accidents or undesirable occurrences considering that Bohol’s kind of soil is prone to liqqufaction especially during earthquake or seismic event.”

Masamayor also cited bad weather conditions that hinder to achieve the target date of completion. “Aggregates and skilled manpower come from Leyte by barge, hence, a factor also adding to the loss of time.”

He cited also Kawahara’s contention that it took time to cut trees to clear the way for detour bridges. Permission had to be secure and “cutting down the affected trees are really time consuming.”
Masamayor said that despite these snags, the contractor is optimistic to finish the bridges, particularly the Anislag in Maribojoc, Hinawanan and Palo undertaken by one contractor, in August this year.

These bridges are funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (73%) loan and Philippine government (27%).

“These (projects) were bidded out in the regional office but the supervision and implementation is undertaken by the Unified Project management Office (UPMO)” an attached office of the DPWH. (with re[orts from Ric V. Obedencio)
