The provincial government disputedlast week the findings of the Commission on Audit (COA) that it spent some P55.3 million in 2017 for catering services in various activities which the latter  found to be extravagant.

Short of saying that the huge catering fund of P55,320,516.31 is not excessive nor extravagant, May Limbaga, Capitol’s internal auditor,said in the weekly pressconference that the issue on catering spending is no big deal. 

'Dilidakongaisyu (It’s not a big issue)', she said.

COA said in its annual audit report posted in its website recently that the provincial government has spent a total of P55,320,516.31 for various catering services last year contrary to specific laws.

It said the total amount of P55,320,516.31 was spent in CY 2017 for food catering services which were indiscriminately provided during all events/gatherings of the province during the year, which is not in keeping with P.D. 1445 and incompatible with the purposes in section 343 of RA 7160.'

After scrutiny of pertinent documents, COA said these catering services are excessive and extravagant.

The breakdown of P55,320,516.31 follows: 'Kita ugAngGobernador' spends total of P439,920 last year with six catering vouchers; visit of dignitaries, P869,700; medical mission/outreach/job fair, P2,164,100; assemblies/summit/congress, P2,114,927.25; celebrations/festivals, P4,719,535; assessments, P5,282,703.64; various programs, P5,468,756.92; orientation, P5,710,728; and other activities/gatherings, P9,075,986.17.

COA explains that 'excessive expenditures signify unreasonable expense and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits.'

COA acknowledged that under section 465b of RA 7160, the provincial governor is authorized to call and hold assemblies, conventions, seminars and the like of any elective or appointive officials.

But they are mandated to observe section 343 of RA 7160, provides that 'no money shall be appropriated used or paid for entertainment or reception except to the extent of the representation allowances authorized by law or for the reception of visiting dignitaries of foreign governments or foreign missions, or when expressly authorized by the president in specific cases.'

COA said that after review of documents and general ledger, it found the 'catering/meal services are provided in practically all the activities of the provincial government.'
 
The amount P55,320,516.31 represents 53% of the total expenses spent on training, representations and other Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of P103,944,242.19, COA said.

It said that the meals provided by the province in almost every event raised doubts as to the government’s 'commitment for efficient and economic discharge of its functions considering the huge amount of P55,320,516.31 incurred for meals.'

Limbaga said that the amount is accrued, not only in 2017, but also in 2016. In other words, the amount of P55,320,516.31 incurred for meals does not only covered in 2017 as COA stressed but also in 2016.

It covers 760 activities during the total 1,223 activity days, Limbaga retorted.
Activities such as anti-drug campaign, information technology, financial management, energy development, youth and sports, workshops, hosting of ASEAN, visiting local and international dignitaries, peace/order meetings, among others, she said.

Hence, it’s not 'one-time deal' since it covers a lot of activities during or within 2016 and 2017, she said. (rvo)
