A third-party technical report has identified the cause of the partial collapse of the under-construction commercial buildingthat killed a worker and injured three others in Tagbilaran City on August 1.

But City Councilor Augustinus “Dodong” Gonzaga and other city lawmakers still want the project engineer of Dakay Construction and Development Corp. (DCDC) to appear to the SangguniangPanlungsod (SP).

“Public safety is the main concern here and, even if it may not be proactive, the city legislature has to be guided to what necessary policy may be enacted,” the lawmaker said.

Gonzaga said the report is the assessment of the structural stability and safety of the building based on the actual inspection by the Cebu-based E.F. Velarde Structural Design & Consultancy.

The affected structure is the under-construction AltaCitta commercial building owned by the Alturas Group of Companies and located right on the former site of the Holy Name University.

The design and construction of the roof were done with 3.40-meter overhang extension carrying a 1.0m solid parapet wall at the end, according to the evaluation.

The framing system, the report continued, on the roof beams was “not balanced due to the non-continuity on the adjacent span.”

It was further assessed that the “concentrated load from the concrete parapet wall transmitted large stress to both the beams and columns.”

The “required reinforcement was sufficiently followed, but a special bar diagram detail (should) play a great role to attain stability,” the lack of which becoming the “possible cause of failure,” the report said.

The “independent” assessment was signed by Engr. Edgar F. Velarde, although his technical services were said to be hired by the contractor itself.

Velarde mentioned in his report the type, location and owner of the partly-collapsed structure, even the number of its floors, but never named Dakay as thecontractor.
He certified thatrandom checks on the structural components were performed in visible areas.

The purpose of the inspection was to evaluate the structural failure of the roof beams that resulted in the collapse.

Still, Gonzaga said the project engineer of the DCDC will be again invited to the city council since the contractor firm was so far represented by its lawyer.

The SP member  is verifying a report that Dakay Construction has not secured a business permit since 2016, which is otherwise required under the revenue code of the city.

Also, Gonzaga would like to hear from the project engineer as there are workers in the construction area despite the temporary work stoppage order from the labor department.
To attain safety and stability, the assessment report “highly recommended” the “changing of the framing system to a balance frame.”

“Roof structural members must be changed from concrete to steel” as “this will minimize load impact, stress and fatigue,” the report said.

Structural components like the other columns, beams, and slabs below the roof level are not affected and “pose no danger.”

Despite the incident, the building is “structurally sound, stable and safe for occupancy” as it is “conforming to the national structural code and generally accepted engineering principles and practices.”

The technical report said the structure “passed the minimum structural standards to assure public safety.”

Gonzaga said the city council is not going to the extent of applying in court to hold in contempt any Dakay representative who snubs the SP invitation to appear.
But despite the submission of pertinent documents, the city legislature will one more time ask the Dakay engineer to honor the invitation of the lawmaking body of Bohol’s capital and only city. (VenreboArigo)
