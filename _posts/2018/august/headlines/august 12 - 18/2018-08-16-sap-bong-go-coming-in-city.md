If plans do not miscarry, Special Assistant to the President Christopher “Bong” Go will be coming over here this week.

Go, acknowledged as the presidential photo bomber and selfie king, is a sought-after national figure by local politicians.

A source who refused to be identified told the Bohol Sunday News that Go, who is reportedly gunning for a Senate seat, will grace the birthday celebration of Boy Pernia, media consultant of Cong. Aris C. Aumentado this week.

Go has been invited by Mayor Marietta Sumaylo of Dauis to join the Dinagat Festival last week.

He was also invited by top City Hall officials to join in one of its major activities.
Go declined both invitations allegedly due to his busy schedule.

Pernia is a top official of the AlyansangBol-anongalangsaKausaban (ABAKA) perceived to be a political alliance supporting the possible gubernatorial candidacy of Cabinet Sec. Leoncio B. Evasco Jr.

Tomorrow, ABAKA will formally align with the HugpongngPagbabago (HNP) during an organizational meeting in Manila.

ABAKA is chaired by businessman Norris Oculam.

Go has identified himself as part of the HNP led by Davao City Mayor Sara Z. Duterte-Carpio,
