hl-desc: "While others claim that the death in a building construction is an offer to the earth, an aerial view of a building at the corner of H. Grupo and CPG Avenue is of no exception. The commercial building is contracted by Dakay Construction of Cebu which became viral in the social media after its beam caved in last Wednesday afternoon.
