Despite high market prices of fish and fuel plus an excessive charges of local hotel rates and restaurants, Capitol issued a statement yesterday bragging a 9.1% economic growth beating the national average.

In a press statement, the propaganda arm of the provincial government, EdCom, said more investors now look up to Bohol’s economy which steady growth at 9.1% has, according to the country’s monetary and economic managers, surpassed the national average.

A further stronger indicator of this will be the rise of the full Bohol branch of the BangkoSentralngPilipinas (BSP) nearby the Bohol-Panglao international airport, which is soon to operate.

Bohol posted the impressive average growth of 9.1% in 2014-2017, higher than the national average quoting BSP Gov. Nestor Espenilla, Jr.adding that developments “are really happening on the ground.”

National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Sec. Ernesto Pernia said the country has kept its “high and steady” economic growth from 6.7% last year to 6.8% in the first quarter of 2018.

Along with Gov. Edgar M. Chatto, Espenilla and Pernia led the groundbreaking and time capsule-laying for the BSP-Bohol project in Tinago, Dauis on Monday.
They also led on the same day the Bohol Economic Forum as facilitated by the provincial government and business sector at Bohol Tropics in Tagbilaran City. 

Chatto said the Bohol central bank---which is BSP’s 20th branch, excluding the three regional offices in Cebu, La Union and Davao---indicates that Bohol is “in fast motion to a desired greater growth.”

The province’s newest investment promotion video, entitled the Behold Bohol for Business Investment, was launched, lauded and applauded during the forum.
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Reg’l. Dir. Aster Caberte highlighted why the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) do matter to inclusive growth in Bohol and the country.

On behalf of DTI Usec. ZenaidaMaglaya, whose message to the forum was read, Caberte cited the essence of the new law, Republic Act 11032, which promotes the ease of doing business.

Provincial Administrator Alfonso Damalerio II presented a comprehensive update of the socio-economic indicators of Bohol.

For one, he presented the large investments in tourism, agriculture, medical and enterprise areas in 2014-2017 alone that already amounted to nearly P7.4 billion.
In 2017, actual MSMEs investments reached P1.5 billion, at the same time sustaining the generation of employment with recorded almost 12,000 jobs provided in the same year.

Tourist arrivals marked an annual average increase of 30% for the last five years, with over 1.1 million tourists recorded in 2017 while accommodation facilities totaled 502 also last year.

Among the telling factors for putting up a BSP branch in Bohol are the magnitude of economic activities, presence of significant industry and service sectors, sufficient infrastructure, and safety and security.

According to Espenilla, Bohol’s 9.1% economic growth did cause the Monetary Board to approve the request of Chatto and the business sector, notably the banking industry, to open a BSP branch here.

What they further want, Espenilla said, is to supply Bohol with cleaner, world-class currency bills and coins that befit the province’s status as an international tourist and investment destination.

Bohol must have again led and inspired others as many provinces now ask the BSP to establish branches in their areas, too.

The Bohol central bank facility will be the newest in the country and is expected to be completed and operational by 2020. 

Also cited by the NEDA and DTI during the forum, the BSP’s official evaluation of Bohol’s economic performance has not only effectively corrected the false, ignorant claim that Bohol has no progress.

Espenilla said the feat has manifested this early a brighter Bohol future as evidenced by the robust inflow of investments and sustained financial, commercial and tourism activities.

But very significantly, the 9.1% average economic growth rate has correlated with Bohol’s 21.7% poverty incidence drop recently from 50.2% in 2000.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), Bohol is no longer in the list of the poorest provinces in the country.

Bohol has been out of the list with its dramatic 21.7% poverty incidence reduction from 50.2% 18 years ago when it was still among the country’s poorest provinces.
Based on the latest PSA datareleased in 2015, these are the poorest provinces, by ranking: Lanaodel Sur, Sulu, Siquijor, Maguindanao, Northern Samar, Sarangani, Bukidnon, Zamboanga del Norte, Western Samar, Sultan Kudarat, Negros Oriental,Eastern Samar, Agusan del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Masbate, North Cotabato, Catanduanes, Surigao del Sur, Sorsogon and Apayao.

The very strong public-private partnership championed in Bohol governance has helped the business community itself to deal in positive ways with the challenges of a growing economy.

This was according to Engr. Albert Uy, president of the Bohol Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), in his response to the forum speakers’ inputs on the rapid local economic landscape changes.

“Our thanks to our dynamic governor, Edgar Chatto, for his type of governance which is consultative and participative,” he said.

The various sectors are, Uy said, in the “loop of his (Chatto) governance” and “not only informed of the direction the province is taking” but given the “share in charting the direction.”

To the BCCI president, “this synergy is perhaps the best-kept secrets of our good governor why the Bohol LGU is such a dynamo, an achiever, a performer.”

Likewise, Uy cited Tagbilaran City’s leadership by City Mayor Baba Yap, saying the city already systemized the ease of doing business even before the passing of the national law.

But he appealed to the banking sector and other financial institutions to “create more friendly loan applicationand processes” for the micro and small enterprises.
However, Uy said, it is the auto loan being the top consumer product for banks, followed by the bank loans for the MSMEs.

According to Mayor Yap, about 400 cars/motor vehicles are sold in Bohol monthly while Damalerio said the number of registered vehicles increased by an average of 12% for the last three years. (with reports from VenreboArigo)
