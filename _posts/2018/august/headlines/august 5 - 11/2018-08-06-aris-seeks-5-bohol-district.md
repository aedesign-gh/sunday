Cong. Erico Aristotle C. Aumentado (2nd District, Bohol) displayed his wide foresight in filing House Bill No. 7999 last week re-apportioning Bohol into five congressional districts.

The second district solon explained in his prefatory note in the bill that there is a need to reapportion Bohol into five districts because Boholanos deserve more projects considering the geographical size of the province and the increase in population.

HB 7999 filed on Aug. 1, Aumentado proposed that the first district shall be composed of Tagbilaran City and the seven towns of Alburquerque, Baclayon, Corella, Cortes, Dauis, Panglao, and Sikatuna.

The second district shall cover 10 municipalities includingAntequera, Balilihan, Calape, Catigbian, Clarin, Loon, Maribojoc, Sagbayan, San Isidro, and Tubigon.

The third district will have nine towns which includesAnda, Buenavista, Candijay, Dagohoy, Danao, Guindulman, Inabanga, Pilar, and Sierra Bullones.

The fourth district consists of nine municipalities including Alicia, Bien Unido, Getafe, Mabini, President Carlos P. Garcia, San Miguel, Talibon, Trinidad, and Ubay.

The fifth district will have 12 towns includingBatuan, Bilar, Carmen, Dimiao, Duero, Garcia-Hernandez, Jagna, Lila, Loay, Loboc, Sevilla, and Valencia.

In his bill, Aumentado explained that his intention in proposing to reapportion Bohol into five districts is “to see to it that more people benefit from government services.”

He also stressed that providing additional legislative districts will mean additional budget allocations for the province which in turn will boost the development in the countryside as more representations in Congress will mean more watchdogs and defenders to push for vital legislations that will spur development for the province.

In his Bill, Aumentado proposed that reapportioning of Bohol into five districts would commence in the next national and local elections after its effectivity into law.

He also added that the incumbent representatives of the first, second and third districts of Bohol shall continue to represent their respective districts until the new representatives shall have been elected and qualified.

Earlier, there have been moves by the city and the provincial boards seeking for an increase in the congressional districts in the province.

However, the proposal has only a maximum of four districts.
