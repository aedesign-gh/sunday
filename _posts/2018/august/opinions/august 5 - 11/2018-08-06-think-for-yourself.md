Think for yourself
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

Sen.MigsZubiri recently said, “Now that the Bangsamoro Organic Law has been approved, the more difficult part begins”.

We agree. The enactment of the law, while it took a long and arduous process, is not the most difficult part. The most difficult part is its implementation. How many provinces will be part of the Bangsamoro Territory? What happens to the Christians within those provinces? Can the Muslim leaders who spearheaded the establishment of a Bangsamoro Territory control the Abu Sayaff, Maute, BIFF, ISIS and the like?

We took time to read the draft Bangsamoro Basic Law or BBL as proposed by the Bangsamoro Transition Commission. We were worried because its Preamble does not even mention the Philippines. That is our main concern. We are apprehensive that the Bangsamoro might not consider themselves as Filipinos and will eventually secede.

The Bangsamoro Organic Law or BOL, which was the version that was enacted into law through a Bicameral Committee composed of representatives from the House and the Senate, is worded in a clearer language. It was clarified in the Preamble itself that the Bangsamoro Territory is part of the Republic of the Philippines and operates under our Constitution. To the credit of President Duterte, he pronounced this also as his own personal stand.

This week, however, bombings in Basilan, after the passage of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, hugged the news headlines. This is what Zubiri is talking about. Challenges are beginning to crop up. Does it mean that these criminal elements in Mindanao are not happy with the BOL? The answer is obvious. They are not happy because what they really want is a government controlled by their extremist beliefs.

Nevertheless, we are of the view that the BOL should be given a chance to get implemented. It is a test case for Federalism because the set up of the new Bangsamoro Territorial Government is Federal in form. If it succeeds, then we have a good example. If it fails, then we know what not to do. This brings us to the obvious conclusion. We should not rush the move to change our Constitution into a Federal form. Let us see first if the Bangsamoro experiment will succeed or not.

This week’s quotes come from Brother Eddie and CJ Davide: Brother Eddie Villanueva: “For the President to insult God is a highest form of blasphemy”.Former Chief Justice HilarioDavide: “Federalism is paradise for politicians, hell for the people”.

We don’t have to swallow what they say and believe them immediately. It is best to think for ourselves and weigh the issues intelligently. Who knows if they’re right after all?
