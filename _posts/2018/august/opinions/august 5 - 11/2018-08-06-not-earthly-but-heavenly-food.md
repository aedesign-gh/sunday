18th Sunday of the Year(cycle B)
Readings:	Ex16:2-4,12-15; Eph4:17,20-24; Jn6:24-35

One time, when we were still seminarians, we were having our hospital apostolate.  When I was outside eating bread for snacks, a Badjao begged for some food.  I shared the little child some part of my bread.  But then suddenly a group of Badjaos immediately swarmed around me asking for bread.  Being a student, I did not have enough money to buy them bread.  Some of them got angry at me for not giving them food.  I guess some of you here share the same experience as mine.  More or less this is the scenario of our Gospel this Sunday.

As I said in last Sunday’s sharing that in Israel the common people used to have one meal a day.  And it was their dream just to have plenty of bread and, if possible, to eat three times a day.  The Gospel last Sunday told us about the miracle of the multiplication of the bread by Jesus.  Our Gospel today is a continuation of the story.
We see that after seeing the miracle that Jesus performed, these people now thought that Jesus can provide the bread they need without them working at all.  So they tried to seek for Jesus.  They seek him out only for one reason: they have been given a lot of bread, gratuitously, and they hope to continue being fed like this forever, without having to work anymore.

Instead of replying to their question, Jesus reproaches those who are looking for him only to solve their material problems through miracles: “Do not work for food that goes bad, but work for food that endures for eternal life”.  He does not come to magically change stones into bread.  He wants people to understand the deep meaning of the sign he has worked.

Just like these people in the Gospel, many of us do not understand God, Christ, and religion.  Why do so many people today seem to be looking for God, for Christ, for a religion?  Is it not because in their hearts they have the secret hope of getting some favors or even seeing some extraordinary miracle?  Did we understand the meaning of the sign of the bread, or are we like the Jews who keep looking for Jesus only “for the food that goes bad”?

The people in the Gospel speak of their ancestors who ate manna from heaven and attributed this miracle to Moses.  The manna used as food in the desert by the people of Israel should not be imagined to have been like a miraculous rain from heaven.  There is a “natural” substance, a kind of sugar that oozes out of some shrubs growing in the Sinai desert.  God taught his people in the desert to use this stuff as food.  It was not like a rain from heaven.  It was natural, and God, through Moses, told the people get some food from what is provided by nature.

As we see, God never grants graces to foster laziness.  The gift of manna, which is a help to his people, is also a test, a stimulus to grow in faith.  The test consist in this: the people of Israel cannot gather food for the following day; they must be satisfied with their “daily bread”; they must show that they trust the provident love of God.

In the Gospel, Jesus asks for unconditional trust in God and in Him: “This is carrying out God’s work: you must believe in the one he has sent.”  Jesus specifies that it was not Moses who provided food from heaven, it was the Father, and the same Father today is giving the world not manna, a food which nourishes a perishable life, but the true bread from heaven, the bread that will grant immortality to the whole of humankind – Jesus Christ himself.

We feel all kinds of hunger in our lives: hunger for bread, yes, but also hunger for freedom, love, peace, brotherliness, respect, esteem, happiness.  The Bible often uses hunger and thirst to mean our search and need for God and happiness.  People try to satisfy this need through material things, but in the end they will end up still be unsatisfied.  The only read that can satisfy the need for happiness and peace is the Word of God.  But this Word cannot be effective if it remains something in the past.  It must be assimilated by us day after day, like the bread that once eaten, becomes part of the person.
