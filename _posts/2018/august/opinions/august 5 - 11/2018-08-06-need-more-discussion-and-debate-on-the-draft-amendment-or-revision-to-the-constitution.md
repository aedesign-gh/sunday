We congratulate the Consultative Committee (ConCom) created by President Duterte to draft a Constitution that would shift our unitary form of government to that of the federal government.  After only five (5) months of hard labor, the ConCom submitted their draft to the President onJuly 3. 2018. (Boholano lawyer, Victor de la Cerna is a member of this ConCom).  It will now be up to Congress to deliberate on and approve it for ratification by the people in a plebiscite.  It will still be a long way, however, considering the unresolved issue on whether Congress will vote on it as one body or vote on it separately.  The 1987 Constitution is vague on this. A three-fourths vote will send it to plebiscite.

Former SupremeCourt Justice Antonio Eduardo Nachura who is a member of the ConComwas in Bohol last Saturday to lecture on the highlights of the draft Constitution to generate discussion and understanding on its merits as part of ConCom’s plan to help disseminate the draft to the people.   His lecture was held at the Skills Training and Laboratory hall of the Holy Name University.

It is worth noting that in only five months, the ConCom was able to produce a 31,500 word-Constitution while the Cory Constitution of 1987 took six months to draft and only had 21,700 words.  The U.S. Constitution has only 4,500 words. With so many details put into the Constitution, I wonder if the federal and regional federated legislatures will still have work to do.

The more contentious issues already raised by those who have initially reactedto the draft Constitutionhas been proven a misinformation.  

For example there were those who said that the draft did not contain a clear position on our national territory, especially on the West Philippine Sea that is also being claimed by China. The provision on National Territory has two sections that declare sovereign rights over Philippine Rise and sovereignty over territories belonging to the Philippines “by historic right or legal title.” It also mentions international law anddecisions by international tribunals and therefore has firmed up our stance on the West Philippine Sea.

The Senate will now have 36 members, two each to be elected from the 18 Federated Regions, while the House of Representatives will now have 400 members.  All those seeking the position must possess at least a college degree or its equivalent.  They will serve for four (4) years and may run only for one re-election.

As to the Executive, the President and Vice President will be elected as a team.  Like the legislators they also serve for a term of four (4) years and may run for only one re-election.

It is in the Judiciary and the Constitutional Commissions that the change is more glaring.  There will now be Federal Supreme Court, a Federal Constitutional Court, a Federal Administrative Court, and a Federal Electoral Court, the lower courts and the special courts that will also be created.

For the Constitutional Commissions, there are now six (6) from the present four (4)  – Federal Civil Service Commission the Federal Commission on Elections, the Federal Commission on Audit, the Federal Commission Human Rights, the Federal Ombudsman Commission, and the Federal Competition Commission. 

Federalism is supposed to strengthen the Federated Regions.  However they will only have a share of 50% of the revenues that will be collected from the FederatedRegion.  While there will be an equalizer fund to be administered by the Federal Intergovernmental Commission to help the regions that need financial assistance, this will only be 3% of the GeneralAppropriations Act.  Remember that at the Federated Region’s level there will be a Regional Governor and a Deputy Regional Governor, a Regional Assembly and Regional Supreme Court Justices whose personnel and operation expenses will be paid out of the budget of the Federated Region.

One catchy provision that I don’t like is the provision on politicalparties. In the guise of strengthening democracy, politicalparties may now solicit fund contributions from individuals and corporations which are tax deductible.  An individual can claim a maximum of P100,000 tax deductions for his or her contribution to political parties but corporations may claim a maximum of P10 million.  Politics will become more expensive that it already is particularly in Bohol.

Well, it will still be a long way before we see the final end of this draft Constitution.  I suggest that the administration of President Duterte create or designate champions in every region or province to fast-tract the information dissemination.  MochaUson, who was earlier suggested to do this, will be a welcome face but I am not sure if she can answer satisfactorily all the questions that will be raised on the draft Constitution.(For comments and suggestions, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
