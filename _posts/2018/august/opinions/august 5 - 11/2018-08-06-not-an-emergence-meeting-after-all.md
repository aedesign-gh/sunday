We were excited on the projected meeting between Cong. Aris C. Aumentado and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte today in Manila as the second district solon was invited for an emergency meeting with the presidential daughter.

What brings to our mind is the possible coalition of the Nationalist Peoples Coalition (NPC) headed by Aumentado, the AlyansangBol-anon alangsaKausaban (ABAKA) and the HugpongngPagbabago (HNP).

These political groups are backing the administration of Pres. Duterte and will mostly likely field a complete slate in Bohol during the local elections next year.

However, our excitement was doused with cold water when we saw pictures of the meeting in Manila with new House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the presidential daughter, who were both wearing red dresses.

It turned out that the emergency meeting was more on a meet up with the congressmen who supported the coup ‘detat against former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and installed Arroyo as the new House Speaker.

Cong. Rene L. Relampagos of the first district was also present in that “emergency” meeting.

We were also reminded of the gospel last Sunday about food for all when Sec. Manny Piǹol of the Department of Agriculture (DA) announced during the opening of the Agri Fair last week that he will soon flood the province with fish within a span of 30 days.

The DA secretary wondered why Bohol, being an island, is scarce with supply of fish causing it to have higher price in the local market.

Reports said a domestic vessel owned by DA anchored at the city wharf bringing in a supply of fish. However, there has been no impact in the local market as the fish traders took advantage of the fish supply and sell it in the same higher price.

The quadruple association of Association of Writers and Radio Announcers Foundation, Inc. (AWRAFI), LubassaDagangBisaya (LUDABI), Bohol Literary Arts Cultural Circle (BLACC) and the National Visayan Cultural Arts, INc. (NAVISCAI) jumpstarted the holding of Star Quest, a singing competition in the barangay level.

The activity kicked off during the pre-fiesta night of Dampas District attended by the officials of the said organizations.

In addition to the Star Quest, it will also sponsor a two-day seminar this coming Aug. 10 and 11 at the JJ’s Seafood Village with the able partnership of the city government under City Mayor Baba Yap.
