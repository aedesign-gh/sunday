Mayor Baba Yap holds the title of having the highest approval rating among politicians in Bohol. His Tagbilaran constituents graded him with 98%. The highest ever in the city’s history. If I were Mayor Baba, I will use my popularity to institute much-needed changes in our city. First, I will establish a program that will allow tricycle drivers to transition from their old, dilapidated and pollutive tricycles to the e-tricycle. There is available funding from international donors for such a crucial project. Second, I will solve the foul smell emitted from the ground in some major city streets, and the “bahong tae” from Marcela Farms that adversely affect my constituents in Manga, Ubujan, even Taloto and Lindaville. And third, I will take care of those retarded fellow human beings roaming our streets half-naked, sometimes even entirely without clothing. He can do these if he wants to. I have no doubts about that. 

RESEARCH PA MORE. Manny Pacquiao was advised by a key staff of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) to do more research before he arrogates to himself the power to interpret the Bible. Even the Pope relies on scholars to help him understand the intricacies of scriptures.Earlier this month, Pope Francis declared that death penalty is non-negotiable; the Church cannot and will not support it.

Meanwhile, Pacman continues to advocate death penalty and wrongly claims that the Bible supports it. I doubt if he understands that most of the countries in the world, especially in Europe, have banned the death penalty. That is why, when President Duterte declared during the first few months of his presidency that he will reimpose the death penalty, the European Union withheld its aid to our country.

GENIUS. Tim Cone is a real genius. He led his third team, Barangay Ginebra, to another championship. First, he led Alaska to a Grand Slam. Then he transferred to Purefoods, and led it to another Grand Slam. This time, it’s Barangay Ginebra chance to be the champion under his tutelage. He is without doubt PBA’s greatest coach, ever. And he is a very humble person.

NO MONEY, NO HONEY.President Duterte recently signed the BangsamoroOrganic Law. Under that law, 5% of our national budget automatically goes to the Bangsamoro without conditions. Our current national budget is about 3 trillion pesos, 5% of that is 150 billion. That is what automatically goes to the Bangsamoro starting next year.Huge sum of money. Bohol’s current budget is only 2.3 billion. Local government units (LGUs) around the country are complaining that the national government failed to release to them 500 billion of their past Internal Revenue Allocation (IRA). They sued the national government and won at the Supreme Court. Budget Secretary Ben Diokno said that the national government has no money to pay both the 5% share of the Bangsamoro and the 500 billion it owes the LGUs.

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez was also quoted this week to have said Federalization of the country will lead to bankruptcy and financial chaos. Aw, wa man diaytayikahatagsamga local governments, nganong mag-alig-alig man tag “pepedederalismo” (binastosni Mocha)? Pun intended.
