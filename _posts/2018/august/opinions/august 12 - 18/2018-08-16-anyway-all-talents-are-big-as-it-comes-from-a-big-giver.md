The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Aug. 12, 2018-Sunday) Matthew 10:7-13- And when ye come into an house, salute it. And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

In our Gospel, Jesus instructed His disciples to preach the gospel of God. Romans 1:16-For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. But we must bear in mind that there are two kinds of preaching, verbal and non-verbal preaching:

It does not matter how big or small your talent and gift, the most important is; it is given away to others. 

Anyway, all talents are big because it comes from a big giver. You will be judged by God not for having a gift but if how you use it for the welfare of others.

1 Timothy 4:16 “Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you. This is your consolation in preaching; salvation. On the other hand, Peace was the first word to say in entering the house. This is the right thing to do because in that way, the family will be blessed. Peace is God. This means if you will say, peace be with you, it is the same, God is with you. Your mouth has power and if it is used properly, it can bless others but if not, it brings disasters to anyone. Psalm 33:6”
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host. This means that the world was created out of the spoken words of God. This is what I mean, if you speak good things, it will occur. Be sure to speak good things only and not evil things because you are the one who will suffer the consequences. What you will say, it will come and occur in your life or to the lives of others. Be positives in your words always.
