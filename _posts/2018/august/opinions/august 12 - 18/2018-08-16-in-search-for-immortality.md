In 3rd century BC, the first emperor of unified China, the one responsible of the Great Wall, Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di, was so obsessed with the idea of immortality.  Not content with his mortal conquests and successes, the First Emperor was determined to attain immortality by any means. SimaQian records a number of the ruler’s elaborate and expensive but ultimately futile attempts to discover and access legendary sources of eternal life.

In 16th century AD, shortly after Columbus discovered America, rumors spread that the new world contained a fountain of youth.  The Spanish, Juan Ponce de Leon, outfitted a ship and sailed to America to search for this legendary fountain.

In 1933, British author, James Hilton wrote a novel entitled Lost Horizon.  In that novel, he mentioned the place called Shangri-La a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia – a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal.

We learn from these different accounts that from the beginning of time people have dreamed about never dying.  They have dreamed about living forever.  They have dreamed about eternal life.

And so when Jesus showed up in Palestine and began talking about eternal life, people flocked to hear what he had to say.  Jews were interested.  Since the time of Abraham and Moses, they do not have a clear idea as to what happened to their dead.

They believed there was a “world of the dead”, but they had no idea what that world was like.  And so any light Jesus could throw on the mystery was welcome.

One of the most remarkable things Jesus said about eternal life is he says in today’s Gospel: I am the bread of life… that comes down from heaven… If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever.  The read that I willgive him is my flesh, which I give so that the world may live.

Jesus reveals that life in this world is not the end of things.  There is another life to come.  And that life will never end.  It is an eternal life, it is an everlasting life.

We have gathered together to hear the word of Jesus about eternal life.  We have gathered together to be nourished by the Body of Jesus, the bread of eternal life.

What Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di searched, what Juan Ponce de Leon searched, what James Hilton wrote in his novel is with us in this church today.

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the fountain and wellspring of eternal life is with us right now.  He is with us in his spirit, in his word, in his representative, and, most of all, in the sacrament of eternal life.

Jesus is the bread of life; which means that he is the essential for life; therefore to refuse the invitation and command of Jesus is to miss life and to die. To refuse the offer of Jesus is to miss life in this world and in the world to come; whereas to accept his offer is to find real life in this world and glory in the world to come.
