The collapse last week of the beams of an ongoing constructed building in the city is a sort of a blessing in disguise. Had it had been finished and occupied by tenants as it is designed as a call center and a business establishment, many would have died.  A construction worker died, but perhaps his time was up. Many claimed it was better the catastrophe happened earlier or many would have perished.

People who had seen the damage building were surprised to see that the texture of the beams and columns were not sturdy looking. They suspected the sand and cement did not conform to the standard mixture for strength and stability. They claimed they did not see gravel on the mixture of the concrete beams. Others said there was no foul play in the accident being a private company.

Workers who were interviewed said they removed the scaffoldings of the beams to be used in another area of the building. Buildings do not become strong until the walls and partitions are put in place. The beams collapsed because there were still no walls to help support its weight when the scaffoldings were removed. Being rainy days, the concrete might not have yet dried up inside which might be one of the factors for its collapse. 

There was a tall building at the downtown of Tagbilaran built in the 70s. She was the tallest on her time reasons that the relay antenna of a communication service provider were erected in her uppermost floor in early 2000s. When the building owners began to add  additional floors to the building, city hall officials and the Air Transportation Office came and stopped the construction because the building  lies directly beneath the flight corridor of the airplanes. But a few months after, a taller building was constructed right across the old building to the surprise of the owners whose construction works were being halted.  

The old building was retrofitted last 2012. Its beams and pillars were bored at random to test its strength. And workers found out the old building was still very strong built like a bomb shelter. The building was strengthened with fiber plastics and its pillars bolted with steel plates. And when the 2013 Bohol earthquake struck, the building stood unscathed. The old building was the first building in the province to be retrofitted the modern way. 

In the United States buildings which are 50 years old and above are to be demolished for safety purposes. We do not have that law here in the Philippines. It is cheaper to build than to demolish a building. How to demolish a building is expensive because preventions are made that the adjacent buildings could be not be damage. But nowadays, there are techniques to strengthen and retrofit a building for economic reasons.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Things happens for a reason.
