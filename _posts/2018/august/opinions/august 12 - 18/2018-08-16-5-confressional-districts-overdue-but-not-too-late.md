We hail Cong. ArisAumentado’s House Bill No. 7999 reapportioning the Province of Bohol into five (5) congressional districts.  Although this has elicited mixed reactions mostly from incumbent politicians who only have their interests to think of,there is much wisdom in the proposed law. Cong. Ariswas too humble to say that he was only acceding to the sentiments of the Ligangmga Barangay, and League of Mayors of the Philippines, Bohol Chapter. I would even say that the measure should have been proposed long before but it’s not too late.

Viewed in the light of the present government structure and if and when the shift to Federalism materializes, adding two (2) more congressional districts can only mean more benefits to the province and the Boholanos. The proposal of five (5) congressional districts is in accordance to and compliant with the Constitutional requirement of at least 250,000 population to create one congressional district.  Bohol now has 1.3+ million population.

The reservations made by incumbent politicians is more on how the five proposed congressional districts are structured more than an opposition to the redistricting from three (3) to five (5) districts.  This is understandable, and Cong. Aris has said that this is still subject to consultations with the political leaders of the province, the municipalities and the barangays.  The eventual consultation with the people, of course, will be during the plebiscite to ratify the legislative measure.

To the politicians, their concern will not be on whether the legislative measure will be good for the province.  Rather it will be on whether the redistricting will benefit them politically.  If a politician is now a mayor wanting to become congressman/congresswoman, his or her question would be, “Do I have political clout in the other municipalities where my town will be made part of the congressional district?” His or her ‘winnability’ will only be the sole criterion for disagreeing to the legislative measure.

It will always be political self-preservation first before that of the public.  Anyone who claims otherwise does not know his or her politics.

It is expected then that the bill will get the support of the political leaders of Bohol especially the two other incumbent congressmen, Con. Rene L. Relampagos of the 1st District and Cong. Arthur Yap of the 3rd District.  We suggest for them to even co-author it to show unity for the good of Bohol as the measure can never be against the good of Bohol.

As proposed, District 1 will have eight (8) towns and one(1) city (Alburquerque, Baclayon, Corella, Cortes, Dauis, Panglao,Sikatuna and Tagbilaran City which are already being proposed as Metro Tagbilaran); District 2 will have 10 towns (Antequera, Balilihan, Calape, Catigbian, Clarin, Loon Maribojoc,  Sagbayan, San Isidro, and Tubigon); District 3 will have eight (8) towns (Anda, Buenavista, Candijay, Dagohoy,Danao, Inabanga, Pilar, and Sierra Bullones); District 4 will have nine (9) towns (Alicia, Bien Unido, Getafe, Mabini, Pres. Carlos P, Garcia, San Miguel, Talibon, Trinidad and Ubay);  and District 5 will have 13 towns (Batuan, Bilar, Carmen, Dimiao, Duero, Guindulman, Garcia Hernandez, Jagna, Lila, Loay, Loboc, Sevilla and Valencia).  Am sure this composition of the five (5) districts have been well studied by Cong. Aris to make sure that the minimum requirement of 250,000 population has been met and the balance potential for development has been considered.

Again given the present structure of our government, the more representation in the House of Representatives, the better for any province.  The mandate of the House of Representatives is to pass laws.  But we also know that in the performance of that mandate, each member is allocated funds for the development of their congressional districts on top of what they get from congressional insertions during budget deliberations and what local governments share from the internal revenue allocations.

Before the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) was scrapped as a result of charges filed against Janet Napoles for PDAF scam,  each Congressman was allocated P70 million annually.  That only translated to P210 million PDAF annually for Bohol.  With five (5) districts and for the same allocation, Bohol will now have P350 million. Cong. Aris was saying that it will now be P1billion?

Lately, Sen. PanfiloLacson was talking of the restoration of PDAF and the possibility of increasing it considering that TRAIN1 has increased funds for the ‘Build,Build,Build’ program of the Duterte administration.

If and when PDAF is resurrected, we suggest that there will be a provision for it to be spent only on countryside development projects – those that will uplift the social and economic condition of the poor.  Other projects can be taken care of by the national government.(For comments and suggestions, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com).
