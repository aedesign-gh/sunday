21st Sunday of the Year(cycle B)
Readings:	Jos24:1-2a,15-17,18b; Eph5:21-32; Jn6:60-69

Have you experienced being rejected because some thought that what you said is hard to accept?  If you are a parent and you keep on telling your children the importance of being responsible and obedient but only to find your children rebelling against you, what would you feel?

We are nearing the conclusion of the speech on the bread of life.  Now we found that many of his disciples rejected what he said (about eating his flesh and drinking his blood); they declare it “intolerable”.  The Jews wanted their messiah to be a triumphant hero ready to provide read freely, as Moses provide manna, and here instead they had a weak man whose request were preposterous.  He said that he embodied the plan of God, demanded belief in himself, pretended that they should approve and share his options and that they identify themselves with him in the sacramental sign of eating his as Eucharistic bread.

The dilemma was then and still is: to have or not to have faith in him.  His proposal can be accepted or rejected.  No negotiation is possible, no modification to make it more acceptable or palatable by cancelling out some of his demands.

In the first reading, we saw how Israel was asked to choose clearly and unequivocally between Yahweh and the other gods.  In the Gospel, we see the disciples of Jesus having to make a choice.  In front of the Eucharistic bread, we also have to decide whom we should follow.  When we eat the Eucharistic bread, we must be clearly aware of what we commit ourselves to: belief in all that Jesus taught and accept so as to identify ourselves with him.  Can one receive Christ in the Eucharist and then go on seeking one’s likes and pleasures, if one thinks only of oneself and one’s interest; if one fails to see and care for the needs of one’s brothers and sisters, and in practice one does not believe in Christ because one refuses to identify oneself with him in life?

The real difficulty of Christianity is two-fold. It demands an act of surrender to Christ, an acceptance of him as the final authority; and it demands a moral standard of the highest level. The disciples were well aware that Jesus had claimed to be the very life and mind of God come down to earth; their difficulty was to accept that as true, with all its implications. To this day many a man refuses Christ, not because he puzzles intellect, but because he challenges his life.

Some shirked the challenge of Jesus. Fundamentally their point of view was that they had come to Jesus to get something from him; when it came to suffering for him and giving to him they quit. No one can give so much as Jesus, but if we come to him solely to get and never to give we will certainly turn back. The man who would follow Jesus must remember that in following him there is always a Cross.

Jesus realizes the difficulty that his disciples find in making a choice.  His reaction?  An invitation to leave the world of the flesh and enter into the world of the Spirit.  If anyone bases their choice on human reason, they will be disappointed and find themselves up against something unacceptable to “common sense”.  Only the persons who are capable of listening willingly to the call of the Father, who let the Spirit move them, will be able to understand and choose Christ.

We too, listening to the Gospel and reflecting on the message of Christ, at times feel full of enthusiasm, while at other times we are disappointed.  Often our more immediate expectations do not materialize; we are hoping that prayer or fidelity to the law of God would obtain for us something specific that we were hoping for: the cure of a loved one, prosperity, or some piece of luck, and nothing happened.  Jesus did not come to satisfy our wishes but to invite our commitment.  Though with some difficulty we should go on repeating our promise of faithfulness, our “yes”, just like Peter and his apostles.  Maybe it will take years of consistent choices and options before we realize, as we look back over our lives with joy, that he has truly led us on our journey to heaven in faith and in the Eucharist.
