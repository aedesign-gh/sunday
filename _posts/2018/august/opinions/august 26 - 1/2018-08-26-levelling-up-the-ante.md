To the dismay of some local officials, Special Assistant to the President Christopher 'Bong' Go will be coming over this week to attend the birthday celebration of our relative, Boy Pernia, media consultant of Cong. Aris C. Aumentado.

Go has become slippery as an eel when he was invited to join the Panagat Festival in Dauis town and upon the invitation of the city hall. He refused on both invitations allegedly due to a busy schedule.

But to attend a birthday party is something else. There must be some message in Go’s actuations. 

There is so much fanfare in the move of the agriculture secretary to flood Bohol with fish this week.

But we are not taking the bait. Reports said a vessel of the Department of Agriculture will arrive here loaded with ten tons of fish from Mindanao. What is the purpose of Sec. Manny Pinol with his move? To lower down the high price of fish in the local market?

We disagree with his approach. The supply of fish will be eaten down by the vultures and leeches in the local fish market. The solution to the problem is not on the supply and demand. It is more on the cartel behind it.

The 90th natal day of former City Vice-Mayor Gloria Neri Lim will be next week yet. But considering the presence of his eldest son, Dr. Abe Lim, and his family, an advance birthday celebrations have been lined up starting yesterday.
Hundreds of political supporters from different barangays here gathered at the Lim residence in Dao District last night to break bread and entertained by performers from Cebu.

The following day, an elaborate birthday bash was held at the MetroCenter Hotel together with the Chinese community and friends including Vice Mayor Toto Veloso and City Councilors Dodong Gonzaga and DodongPolinar. Of course, City Mayor Baba Yap was also present being one of the grandchildren of the birthday celebrant.

To think why the event was held at the MetroCentre Hotel when Gloria Lim’s youngest child, Geesnell, owns the plush Bohol Tropics Resort immediately raises some questions.

Geesnell was not present during the event at the MetroCenter Hotel but was spotted attending another birthday celebration of the matriarch of another Lim family of the Lite Shipping Corp in Panglao.

If one still do not understand the conflict within the family, you must be from Mars.

After almost perfecting a straight nine-year term at the Capitol, one cannot help but be amazed how it can manipulate events in their favor.

Boholanos were jolted when the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) publicly announced that Bohol is No. 1 in drug affectation in Central Visayas and No. 5 in the entire country.

Quick to the draw, the Capitol immediately announced that more than 300 barangays in the province are already drug-free and its ranking in the region is now No. 4, the lowest.

It has been a public knowledge who are those involved in illegal drugs ever since. But considering that they are the powers that be, they are armed to the teeth in repelling any attacks against them.

As of the moment, the Boholanos are helpless in combatting them fair and square. They only make noise in the social media.

But there is always an end to everything and we know for sure that those who benefitted from these illegal transactions will be crucified in the days to come.
