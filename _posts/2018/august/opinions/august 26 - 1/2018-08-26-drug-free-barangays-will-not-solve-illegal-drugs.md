Finally Bohol has been extricated from its disgraceful title of No. 1 illegal drug affected province in Central Visayas and No. 5 throughout the country.  The Philippine Drug Enforcement Administration (PDEA) has announced in a formal ceremony the declassification of 321 barangays of Bohol as drug-free.  The 321 barangays were among the more than 800 barangays in the Province of Bohol that were categorized as drug affected making Bohol the title holder in Region 7 and runner-up in the whole country. 
For this we congratulate the provincial government of Bohol, the provincial police office, the military, the PDEA and all the local governments for posting a high score in the number of barangays declared as drug-free so far.  After years of relentless campaign, the efforts have paid up.  

It is not easy for a barangay to get a drug-free clearance as the process is meticulous and a barangay has to pass several tests and scrutiny by the committees created to screen every barangay.  But even with the meticulous procedure, the drug-free declaration of a barangay is not 100% guarantee that no illegal drug transaction will now happen in that barangay.

Every house in that barangay declared as drug-free may have been posted with a sticker on the door that says “This is a drug-free household.”  But that is no guarantee that no illegal drug transaction will be made on the streets of that barangay, as what happened a few days after the ceremony that declared the 321 barangays as drug-free. The police has successfully conducted a buy-bust operation in one of the 321 barangays.

The challenge of illegal drugs will never be over even in the declared drug-free barangays unless everyone in those barangays will cooperate and remain vigilant all the time. There may no longer be user or pusher who are living in the barangay, but the users and the pushers from uncleared barangays would just be happy to conduct their trade in a cleared barangay knowing that people there are already complacent thinking that their barangay is already declared a drug-free barangay.

The only time we can be sure that there will be no more illegal drug activities in our barangays is when all the big time suppliers, the drug lords and their protectors are put in jail or when they are six feet below the ground.

This was already seen and realized by Pres. Duterte when he told the media people that he wanted to resign because of his frustration at the accomplishment with which his administration’s campaign against illegal drugs has done so far.  He now knows that even with his iron-fist policy and method of solving the problem, the remaining years of his term as President will not be enough to deliver his campaign promise to rid the country of illegal drugs.

Success therefore in the fight against illegal drugs is not in how many barangays have been declared drug-free but in how many barangays can sustain their status of being drug-free in one year.

Another way of seeing the successful end to illegal drugs is in the number of drug dependents who are rehabilitated and living normal lives. I agree with the experts who say that drug addiction is a health problem.  Those illegal drug (substance) dependents are sick and they belong to rehabilitation centers more than the prisons where many of them now are. The Bureau of Jail Management should link with the Department of Health on how rehabilitation sessions can be had by those who are in jail.(For comments or suggestions, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
