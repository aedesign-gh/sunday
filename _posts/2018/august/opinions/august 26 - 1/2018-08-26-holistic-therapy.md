These are really two stories of healing and non-healing, depending on how you look at it.

THE HEALING. Dennis is a friend of mine who had an 11 year old son, Janjan, who was diagnosed as having a malignant tumor in his neck. His wife, Lina, works abroad. 
It was upon Lina’s insistence that Janjan was brought to a local hospital for check-up. The result tested positive. The family felt restless and sought for a second opinion in a hospital in Cebu. The result was the same.

Lina and Dennis were already arguing because Lina wanted to have Janjan undergo radiation and chemotherapy in Cebu. I was disturbed upon hearing of Lina’s assertions. Our own family had an adult member who went through chemotherapy and died after two years. Here, we are talking about an 11 year-old boy. What agony and torture, I could imagine.

I offered an alternative. Another friend of mine belongs to a family of respected doctors in Manila. One of the sons was sent to Germany to study holistic medicine, a kind of medicine that takes the entire individual into account; his diet, environment, his body etc. 'Why don’t you try this for now'? I prayed.

The boy then went through a non-invasive holistic therapy with prescribed diet and other advices. Lina and Dennis communicated with my friend-doctor the whole time. The family spent an average of P1,800 pesos per month. And after six months, my friend-doctor advised the couple to bring their son to the hospital again for check-up. Thanks be to God, he tested negative for cancerous tumor already.

THE NON-HEALING. My friend Myrna’s father, Teody, is also a friend of mine. When I learned of Teody’s condition he was already bed-ridden and had to excrete his human wastes through a tube in his stomach. Even then, aware that Myrna must have been spending so much for Teody’s medicines, I offered the same alternative. Myrna communicated with my friend-doctor, and Teody went through a similar therapy. I do not know how long it went on, but Teody eventually died.

I am not medically-trained and could not tell whether or not Teody’s condition was already terminal when he started the therapy. It was simply out of compassion that I suggested an alternative.I am not out to make outrageous claims. Just telling a true story that others may learn from. And by the way, for the record, I didn’t ask for a single centavo from the doctor nor the patients. Godspeed, Teody.
