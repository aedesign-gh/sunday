Last Tuesday, we motored to Tangnan, Loon to see personally the coral garden they touted as one of its kind in the world.

On our way to Loon, we noticed that there were so many billboards of all kinds and sizes on the side of the road. These billboards were carefully designed to attract attention advertising products ranging from foods to banking and education. These billboards were “weeds” of the scenery.

Weed is define as plants which grow out of place. Rice could be a weed if it grows on a garden of roses.

Sao Paolo in Brazil is the only city in the world where one cannot see a billboard advertising products. The walls of their buildings were scraped off of advertisementsto cleanse the city of billboards. Sao Paolo officials said billboards are considered as sight pollution.


THE CORAL GARDEN

The coral garden is a misnomer. It is not really living corals which covered the shoreline of the two barangays namely Tangnan and Pig-ot in Loon town. Corals are soft and hard bodied marine organisms which died when exposed to the air and sun. 

The red “coral” you see on the above mentioned barangays is actually a succulent crawling plant whose stem is colored red, but its spiky leaves are green. It is a weed named “bilang-bilang” which pigs loved to munch.

The place where the “coral” garden is located was once underwater. The seabed was uplifted during the 2013 Bohol earthquake. How the weeds grow profusely there, no one can explain.

A fisherman was gathering seashells on the shallow lagoon. He looked up when we approached him. “Our seashells here taste differently from Maribojoc,” as he pointed towards Maribojoc town. “We could not explain why”

The word taste sent me to ponder abruptly of the fish from Zamboanga which arrived here last week. Many complained that the fish tasted differently. It made me think that fish might taste differently from place to place.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: When opportunity knocks at your door, grasp it for it will never come again.
