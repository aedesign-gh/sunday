The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Aug. 26, 2018-Sunday) John 13:21-33There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. So Simon Peter gestured to him, and said to him, 'Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.' He, leaning back thus on Jesus' bosom, said to Him, 'Lord, who is it?'

The only thing we can do towards our traitors is to pray for their enlightenment and repentance. Let us kill them by our goodness and kindness. Romans 12:19-21‚ÄùNever take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, 'VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY. Entrust everything to God; you are within struggles and your enemies who did wrong in your life. 

This is my divine logic about this matter; if you will revenge, God will not do it toward your enemies because you take it in your hands. Let God does something to your enemies by waiting the exact timing if when he will do the said revenge. Much appreciating in your part if you will keep quiet although you are hurt too much.

The people around you will appreciate your aura and in that way, you will become their living icon of goodness and of good will. You will be rewarded for not permitting any opponent to hurt you and to damage your within disposition in life. Enemy breaks you only once you allow him to do so in your life. Much better, forgive him not because he deserved it but because you deserved peace within. Do not be sick in having grudges and troubles in your heart. 

The flow of your blood matters because it can create sickness of your body.
