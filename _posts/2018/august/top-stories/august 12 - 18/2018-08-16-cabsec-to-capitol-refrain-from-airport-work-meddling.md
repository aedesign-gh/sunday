Cabinet Sec. LeoncioB. Evasco, Jr. last week minced no words in saying that there are provincial officials who appeared to be meddling and wanted the airport project be completed earlier than what is being scheduled.

But he did not name who these provincial officials meddling the project.
Evasco said Sec. ArthurTugade of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) told him that the airport project should be completed according to its timeline.

He said DOTr stressed that curing time for some of the concrete works of the project should be followed to prevent half-baked job.

If the project would go haywire, the Capitol would not be responsible but the DOTr, Evasco pointed out.

He issued clarification that the provincial government’s role in the New Bohol airport construction is only “to monitor,” or Capitol should not meddle in it, which the latter flatly denied.

Evasco told media in the sidelines of the city airport interview week that he issued clarification that he was not there inspecting the Panglao airport contrary to report he received.

He just happened he was there for a meeting in Panglao. He just asked permission of the airport authorities to see inside the on-going construction work of the New Bohol airport.

The said airport is not the project of the provincial government. But they can monitor its progress, Evasco said in gist.

The P7.7 billion airport project was earlier trumpeted by “some Capitol officials” he did not name to be finished in June of this year. But no completion has been seen yet, according to informed source.

The same “some Capitol officials” has halted bragging about the airport early completion in their press releases, according to the source.

Capitol appeared defending its position in the airport project.

Its writer VenArigo, an EdCompersonnel paid by the provincial government has written a lengthy press release. Part of it said:

“The Bohol-Panglao international airport is, Relampagos said, a contribution by all provincial administrations from the time of Torralba to Chatto’s incumbency.”

“During the Kita ugAngGobernador program, Damalerio narrated the uneasy task of the provincial government in even resettling and relocating the landowners affected by the project.

The provincial government also succeeded in land barter deals with so many landowners, including one SalvioMadanguit who happens to be one of the rabid capitol critics.”

“On another wrong information that capitol is hurrying, Damalerio said it is not the province pressuring the opening of the airport even if it is yet to be completed, substantially or fully.

It was the DOTr then announcing the possible time of the opening of the airport.”
“Damalerio said Evasco was aboard a plane that landed on the Panglao airport runway last November even if it was unallowed and unatuthorized because there was no control tower yet.

“So, who’s in the hurry then?” Damalerio asked.” (rvo)
