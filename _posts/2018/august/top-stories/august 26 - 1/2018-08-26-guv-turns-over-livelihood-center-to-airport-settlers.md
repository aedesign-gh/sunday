Gov. Edgar M. Chatto will turn over to the relocated homeowners a livelihood center which is an essential social responsibility component of the Bohol Panglao international airport project on Wednesday. 

The governor will lead the provincial government in signing a memorandum of agreement with the officers of the New Bohol Airport Neighborhood Association (NBANA) on the center management.

Right inside the resettlement site of the airport project-affected homeowners, the center is planned to be part of the shuttle service route from the airport to Alona beach area.

This will allow the tourists, guests and other visitors to patronize the livelihood products of the very community relocated because of the modern airport co0nstruction.   
Provincial Administrator Alfonso Damalerio II challenged the NBANA members to form themselves into a cooperative so they can avail of more livelihood aids from the government.

The shuttle service can itself provide job to the NBANA settlers who are licensed drivers, according to Damalerio.

The new airport is expected to be opened and commercially operational this year, with the final official advisory awaited from the Department of Transportation and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.

The progress of the airport project as of end of July was presented in the meeting of the Local Project Management Team (LPMT) of the New Bohol Airport Construction and Sustainable Environment Protection Project (NBACSEPP) at Governor’s Mansion Friday.

The provincial administrator led the meeting on behalf of the governor.

Fe Aranas and Marivic Laurito, incoming and outgoing NBANA presidents, respectively, also attended the meeting.

Chatto will induct the new NBANA officers during the livelihood center inauguration and turnover.

Dr. Stella Marie Lapiz, chief of the Office of the Provincial Veterinarian, has closely worked with the Panglao airport resettlement community, especially in facilitating the livelihood skills trainings.

The NBANA members will showcase their processed meat products during the livelihood center turnover.

During the LMPT-NBACSEPP meeting, Damalerio assured the NBANA community of the province’s support to their want of a lot for their chapel, which feast will be observed every December 12.

The provincial government developed the resettlement site of the home and lot owners affected by Panglao airport, which is considered Bohol’s biggest and most important singular economic infrastructure. (Ven rebo Arigo)
