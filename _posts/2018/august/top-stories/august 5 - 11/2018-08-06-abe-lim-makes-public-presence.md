Posing for a possible rematch against his own nephew, Dr. Abe Lim is making his presence felt in the city for the last two weeks now.

The US-based physician ran for city mayor in the 2013 local polls and lost to his nephew, City Mayor Baba Yap, son of his younger sister, Gesnell Lim Yap.

Dr. Lim went home the other week to join the wake of his late brother, Roy, who died due to a lingering illness while staying in Carmen town.

After the internment, Dr. Lim went on a radio spree and was interviewed two times over Station DYTR.

Reports said he had a dinner reunion with party mates at a Korean restaurant last week. Present during the gathering was former City Vice-Mayor Nuevas Montes and former city councilors and barangay officials identified with former City Mayor Dan Neri Lim who was not present during the occasion.

Dr. Lim will stay here until the birthday celebration of his mother, former City Vice-Mayor Gloria N. Lim next week.

The report also said that Dr. Lim met with more than 1,500 barangays leaders identified with the former city mayor in a whole afternoon activity in one of the restaurants in the city.

While not making any promises, Dr. Lim has revived the political spirit of his leaders who were excited to join the gathering.
