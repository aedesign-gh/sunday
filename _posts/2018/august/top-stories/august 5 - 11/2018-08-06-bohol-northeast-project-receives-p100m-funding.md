THE Bohol Northeast Catch Basin Dam – a multifaceted big-time irrigation project – is yet another step closer to realization with a P100-million initial allocation.

Administrator Ricardo Visaya of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) broke the news to Rep. Erico Aristotle C. Aumentado(2nd District, Bohol) during their meeting early last week at the former’s office in Quezon City.

On the catch basin will be a dam to hold the water for controlled release to irrigation canals. This will be supported by flood control structures to avoid flooding the surrounding areas especially during heavy downpours spawned by typhoons or the southeast monsoon.

Water from the dam will also be channeled to flow into turbines that are expected to generate 10 megawatts (MW) of power.

A filtration plant will also be built alongside the dam. This will provide potable water to the host and adjacent barangays, and even nearby municipalities.

The catch basin is expected to irrigate the rice lands in Dagohoy, Danao, San Miguel, Talibon, Trinidad, Bien Unido and Ubay towns.

Meanwhile, Aumentado also requested Visaya to allocate funds for the Hibale Small Reservoir Impounding Project (SRIP). The solon refers to this proposal as a “long overdue” project. Hibale is in Danao town.

Like his namesake father, former governor and immediate congressional predecessor Erico Boyles Aumentado, the son is also pushing for the utilization of dam projects for water sports and tourism projects. In partnering with the local government units in development, NIA helps the host LGUs, the province included, in generating income.

He added that the bigger dams can host floating solar power farms. This will maximize the utilization of dams and address the power shortage in the province. After all, up until now, Bohol is still largely dependent on power from the Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant in Southern Leyte.
