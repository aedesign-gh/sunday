A work stoppage is being eyed over the construction of a new downtown building in the city even as its constructions snubbed the invitation of the SangguniangPanlungsod last week.

This surfaced after city residents were jolted when the beam of a three-storey commercial building being constructed by Dakay Construction at the corner of H. Grupo Street and CPG Avenue caved in resulting to the death of one of the workers and wounding two others.

The lone fatality was identified as one Hilbert Morales, a native of ZamboangaSibugay while the injured persons were William Apatan and Christopher Catigtig.

According to the construction workers, they were removing scaffoldings and gathering plywood when a 100-meter long beam suddenly fell and collapsed at around 5 o’clock in the afternoon last Wednesday.

F02 Dennis Caluňa of the City Fire Station who helped in the retrieval operations said that Morales was pinned down by trusses and concrete materials.

The construction worker died on the spot.

The incident prompted City CouncilorDodong Gonzaga to summon the officials of Dakay Construction to the session of the city lawmaking body in order to shed light on the incident.

However, a letter sent to the city council by the project engineer of the contractor declined to appear claiming that the investigation is still on-going.

Meanwhile, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) here is also eyeing to have a work stoppage on the construction after it concludes its own probe.

Lilia Estillore, DOLE provincial director was reported as saying that an investigation is still on-going and her office may issue an order to suspend the building construction.
