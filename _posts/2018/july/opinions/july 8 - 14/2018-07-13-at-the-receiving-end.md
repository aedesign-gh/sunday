For the past two weeks, we have been at the receiving end of media attacks following the filing of criminal and administrative raps by our correspondent, Fred Amora, with the Visayas Ombudsman.

In that case, we stood as a witness for the publication of a municipal ordinance which saw print late last year in one of the weekly newspapers here.

The complaint was published in this paper a few issues back naming the respondent who is a secretary of a Sangguniang Bayan.

According to the complaint of Amora, it appears that there was a connivance between the SB secretary and a member of the weekly newspaper so that the ordinance contained in 82 pages was published without the necessary award from the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC).

This prompted the newspaper to stop the publication of the municipal ordinance despite the fact that it planned to collect P5,000 per page for a total of P420,000,00.

Out of respect, we excluded the name of media personality.

A week later, a news item from a local radio station mentioned our name as among those facing a case with the Sandiganbayan.

We checked the source of the news item and found out that it came from a national media outfit where a staff of the local newspaper is also writing like us.

Thus, we concluded that the brain behind the publication was one of the the respondent in the complaint filed by Amora with the Visayas Ombudsman.

We know how they operate being a media man by our self. We know the nitty-gritty of the media operation.

Two weeks later, our side was taken regarding the news item aired over a local radio station. We mentioned that there is no need to glorify the issue because it was more than ten years ago and under the doctrine of inordinate delay, the case should be dismissed.

Anticipating that a summon was released by the Visayas Ombudsman to the complaint of Amora, we will not be surprised if the news item regarding us will be included in Page 1 of the said newspaper.

We may be at the receiving end of this matter but we will defend our self in the proper forum.

As the saying goes, some people will shout at your sufferings but will just keep silent on your success.

What we can always say in return is that there is always a poetic justice in the end of every story. Amen.
