Plea of senior citizens: 
reviewSenior Citizen Law

Congress passed into law on February 26, 2004 REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9257, AN ACT GRANTING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND PRIVILEGES TO SENIOR CITIZENS AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7432, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "AN ACT TO MAXIMIZE THE CONTRIBUTION OF SENIOR CITIZENS TO NATION BUILDING, GRANT BENEFITS AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES."

Once more R.A. 9257 enumerated the different privileges that are entitled to Filipino citizens of at least 60 years old whom we now know as senior citizens.  This was precisely because government recognizes that senior citizens, despite their age, can still contribute to nation building given their experiences in various fields of life.

To reiterate, these privileges or entitlements as provided in Section 3 (a,b, f, g, h,) of the law include 20% discounts relative to their utilization of services in hotels and similar lodging establishment, restaurants and recreation centers, and purchase of medicines in all establishments for their exclusive use or enjoyment; on admission fees charged by theaters, cinema houses and concert halls, circuses, carnivals, and other similar places of culture, leisure and amusement; on medical and dental services, and diagnostic and laboratory fees provided under Sec. 4 (e) for free medical and dental service, diagnostic and laboratory fees such as, but not limited to, x-rays, computerized tomography scans and blood tests, in all government facilities, subject to the guidelines to be issued by the Department of Health in coordination with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHILHEALTH); in fare for domestic air and sea travel; in public railways, skyways and bus fare.

Other privileges include tax exemption, education, even employment and after care and many others to make life comfortable for the elderly of society. Not only that.  On top of these discount privileges, is another discount on basic food commodities that they will buy given the guidelines of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of agriculture. Right now these purchases of the basic food commodities give the senior citizens at least 5% discount in the malls here in Tagbilaran City.

The senior citizens are thankful to the government for this special attention given to their care.  Lately however many of them have complained that the 5%  discount on basic commodities is no longer realistic considering how prices of prime commodities have also increased because of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law.  

The TRAIN law may have increased tax exemption but whatever is saved by the poor in their tax exemption cannot compensate for the additional expenses caused by higher prices of prime commodities.  In the end they are at the losing end of the bargain.  Those who were already tax exempt prior to TRAIN law, especially the senior citizens were already suffering from high prices so that must even suffer moreunder the additional burden of increased prices of prime commodities caused by the TRAIN law.

Senior citizens are the first to suffer because not only will they need to buy basic commodities like food, they must also contend with the increased prices of their maintenance medicines.  Not even the 20% discount could assuage them of relief.

It is time the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Agriculture work together to review their guidelines and consider increasing the discount from 5% to even just 10 to 15%.  And better still to expand the commodities that could qualify for the discount like foods that are soft and easy to chew and digestby many toothless senior citizens like oat meals, biscuits, jams and pastries.This is their plea.

Our three congressmen of Bohol can initiate the review to further amend the senior citizens law to make the elders contribute better to nation building.(For Comments and suggestions, please email to:coolrst47@gmail. com)
