Noise of our times
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

It’s been a noisy week in our country. Here are some of the sounds competing for our ears:

Killers:  Bang! Bang! Bang! (Three Roman Catholic priests in Luzon got killed.)

President Duterte: God is stupid. (Bishops cry foul. Sarah Duterte says she does not listen to his father’s shenanigans.)

Bishop: This man is a psychopath. (Malacanang spokesman says Duterte has his own beliefs.)

Brother Eddie Villanueva: President Duterte must apologize.

Pres. Duterte: Why should I? It’s not my god that’s stupid, it’s yours. (Adding insult to injury.)

Armed Forces: Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! (Six policemen were killed by military men in Samar. Misencounter, they say. Worse than Mamasapano, others say.)
Communist chief Jose Maria Sison: It is better to oust Duterte. (This, after peace talks failed.)

President Duterte: China will protect me.

Malaysia: Our ex-Prime Minister Najib ran away with millions of dollars. 
Philippines: Our ex-Dictator Marcos ran away with BILLIONS of dollars!
Police and NBI operatives: Bang! Bang! Bang! (PNP sharpshooter Dumpit dies with alleged drugs in hand. Is there really an anti-drug war in this country or is this all a charade?)

SP Member Abapo: Bak-bak pa more! (DPWH engineers get called and scolded at the Capitol.)

DPWH Engineers: Reblocking is really necessary. But we have no control over contractors.

This week’s best quote is from Atty. Tommy Abapo: “Kanangkalakisa DPWH ngaangsementadongkarsadangamaayo pa sulodsa 11 ngadto’s 15 katuig, unyagub-on ugayohonaronmolungtad pa og 11 ngadto’s 15 katuig,
