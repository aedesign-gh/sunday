On our way home from Loboctown last week,the “manhihilot” was the topic of conversation of my colleagues. One them related that everytime (she mentioned the name of the “manhihilot”)  laid hands on her child,  her childwould be healed from his illness.

It is not easy to be a “manhihilot”, one of my colleagues said. The malady of the person, (the negative force of the sick) will transfer to the “manhihilot”.

Modern “manhililot” nowadays are advisedthat every night they had to release the negative energy they had absorbed and had to embrace a tree to be reenergized.

The topic reminded me of my aunt who was a “manhihilot.”  She had gnarled fingers that massaged screaming children with fever. Her loyal patron was the wife of our then municipal doctor. 

The doctor’s wife surreptitiouslytook her sick child to my aunt. She would see my aunt after her husband had gone to the municipal clinic.  She had second thoughts on the synthetic medicine her husband prescribed because she believed on the healing power of touch.

“Manhihilot” are gifted people. They have strong and large positive forces in themselves capable to heal by their massage and touch. They are people who developed their gifts from God.

Doctors of medicine are trained scientifically and medically, but they are not gifted like the “manhihilot” They prescribed medicine with science in their mind. They learned their craft by laboratory practice and experiments unlike the faith healers of which the “manhihilots” are one of them, to be guided by the unseen powers of God. 

Last Sunday’s gospel told us about a sick woman who strongly believed on the positive power of Jesus Christ.She believed that if she can just touch the hem of Christ’s robe, she would be healed. The woman touched the robe of Jesus from his behind. Why did Jesus know he was touched? It is because Jesus felt his positive energy was depleted and he felt tired. 

In the early 1960s, the height of medical research, the healing power of “manhihilot” were frowned upon by medical practitioners because their ability are pseud-science and not scientific. But at present researchers are discovering back the power of people who heals. They discovered that people with healing power has high positive energy.
Each one of us has the power to heal. This healing power is inherent to all of us, but most of us do not bother to develop our inner and latent ability. Now this ability is being studied in Japan. The Japanese called this “Reiki”. Our “hilot” (massage) is our equivalent of “reiki”.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:Nature heals itself.
