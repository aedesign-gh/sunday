The Gospel of Jesus Christ (July8, 2018-Sunday) Thou gave me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath “anointed” my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loved little.

In Jeremiah 31:3-the LORD hath appeared of old unto me, [saying], Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee. Take note, James 2:13”for he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiced against judgment. 

This is my conviction that all people will be saved at the end if they will come back to God without hesitation. God is never tired in seeking you to be with Him eternally. 

Jesus was in the place where the sinners approached him and it was not an accident but God’s ways to meet the sinners. 

Jesus made the first move to meet the sickly people in all aspects. Jesus made the house of the Pharisee as the avenue to let this woman came to him for repentance. This woman anointed Jesus with oil as a symbol of Jesus importance to her life. The oil she used was expensive but it was nothing for this woman because she gave it to Jesus. 

Give something to God even how expensive it is for you. The value of the thing that you give is a reflection of the disposition of your heart. The most precious thing that you can offer to God is your own life.
