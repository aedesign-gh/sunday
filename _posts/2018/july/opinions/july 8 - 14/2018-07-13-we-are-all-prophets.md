14th Sunday of the Year(cycle B)
Readings: Ezk2:2-5; 2 Cor12:7-10; Mk6:1-6

We have all heard about prophets and prophecies.  We have been taught that all the baptized receive the spirit and become prophets.  But who is a prophet?  The first reading describes such a person.  And the gospel speaks of the rejection that the prophet will receive.

The first reading is the story of the call of Ezekiel and it tells us what characterizes the mission of the prophet.  He is, first of all, a person called by God.  Second, that he is a human being, a weak person, a common mortal.  The prophet is not an angel; he is not a person endowed with special and mysterious faculties.  His authority to speak in the name of God does not come from his extraordinary ability, it comes from having been chosen and called by the voice of the Lord.  Thirdly, this man called by God has a mission to accomplish.  He is not asked to work miracles, to foretell the future, or to do strange things.  God asked him to do just one thing: broadcast his word.  Fourthly, the prophet is sent to certain people, persons who might be well disposed or hostile and stubborn.  He is not to worry about the outcome of his mission.

The Gospel speaks of the rejection that Jesus encountered when he returned home in Nazareth.  Maybe because they are bias with his situation – that he is only a carpenter.  The people of Nazareth wondered how a carpenter could know about God.  They are convinced that the Messiah, the expected liberator, resembles the great and powerful God who sends him.

The Pharisees used to say this prayer daily: “Lord, raise the king, Son of David, at the time you have determined he should reign over Israel; give him strength to pull down the powerful and the unjust, to purify Jerusalem of all the pagans, and put them to flight before him.”  Only a powerful king like David, or a wise one like Solomon, could achieve such feats and begin a new world.  This was no job for a humble thirty-year-old artisan who could only mend doors and windows, or make wooden hoes and ploughs.  With such ideas in mind, there was a little chance that the people of Nazareth could accept Jesus, “the carpenter, the son of Mary,” as the one who had been sent by God.

Then Jesus made a statement that a prophet is not without honor except in his native place and among his own kin and in his own house.

How does this apply to our lives?  Jesus answered that question himself when he said, “No pupil is greater than his teacher; no slave is greater than his master.”

In other words, if people rejected Jesus in his lifetime, we should not be surprised if people reject us, his followers, in our lifetime.  For example, we should not be surprised if people reject us because we oppose destroying innocent life through abortion.  We should not be surprised if people reject us because we speak out in defense of human rights.  We should not be surprised if people reject us because we speak out against the proliferation of drugs.  We should not be surprised if people reject us because we speak out against vote buying.

Every baptized person has a prophetic vocation: all are called to announce to their brothers and sisters the word of God.  They must announce the Gospel faithfully, by word and example, to their children, neighbors, work colleagues, to their brothers and sisters of their community.  In order to be able to do this, one must first listen carefully and devoutly to the word of God, to let it penetrate the innermost recesses of one’s heart.  One must then proclaim it courageously, without changing it, even if the listeners feel disturbed or uneasy.
