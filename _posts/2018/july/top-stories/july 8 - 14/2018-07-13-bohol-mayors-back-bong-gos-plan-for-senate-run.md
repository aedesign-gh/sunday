Supporters of Special Assistant to the President (SAP) Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go gathered at Holy Name University (HNU) on Saturday to launch “Bayan for Bong Go” Bohol Movement which aims to encourage him to run for a Senate seat in 2019.

It was attended by at least 17 mayors, barangay and SK officials and volunteers from the different parts of the province.

The mayors who attended the movement were Tagbilaran Mayor Baba Yap, Mayors Allen Ray Piezas of Clarin, Lynn Iven Lim of Cortes, Marietta Sumaylo of Dauis, Judith Cajes of Trinidad, Restituto B. Auxtero of Talibon, SofronioApat of Dagohoy, Pedro Fuertes of Panglao, TitaGallentes of Garcia Hernandez, Nelson Yu of Calape, Regina Salazar of Lila, Ricardo Suarez of Sagbayan, Eugenio BuslonDatahan II of Pilar, William Jao of Tubigon, Christopher Bernados Tutor of Candijay, Jose Mario Pahang of Antequera and MarnilouAyuban of Alicia.

Also present were former Loay Mayor Rosemarie Lim-Imboy and former Loboc Mayor Leon Calipusan.

Businessman Lucio Lim, Jr., the movement’s chairperson, said they were seeing Go’s potential and were encouraging him to run in the 2019 mid-term elections.

“We are calling SAP Bong Go to run for senator. Here in Bohol, the members of business sector want him to run,” said Lim.

“He comes from a family of businessmen. He is very approachable, (and) humble,” he added.

Lim said that being the President’s direct link to the people, Go vowed to continue the President’s campaign against illegal drugs, criminality and corruption. He also said that he supported Duterte’s anti-poverty efforts.

“SAP Bong Ro represents change. It gives us hope that the legacy of President Duterte may continue through SAP Bong Go in the Senate,” Lim said.

Go was not able to attend the launching because he was with the President.

Instead he was presented by Assistant Secretary Mon Cualoping of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) and Interior Assistant Secretary for Legislative and External Affairs Ricojudge “RJ” Echiverri, former two-term president of the National Ligangmga Barangay.

Go earlier told reporters that he was still contemplating whether or not to run in the senatorial race.

He said he was committed to serving the President “until kingdom come.”
