REP. Erico Aristotle C. Aumentado has been making the rounds of Bohol’s 2nd District to inspect ongoing multipurpose building projects in all barangays. The inspections ensure that the buildings will be sturdy and good for the next 10 years.

For those whose buildings have yet to take shape, like in barangay San Miguel in Danao town, Aumentado announced the upcoming release next year of ₱700,000 for the purpose from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

Danao Mayor Natividad Gonzaga had asked for a special assembly at the barangay hall during which the solon made his announcement.

As designed, the building can also serve as evacuation center in times of calamity, and a venue for sports and cultural activities. The building will also have toilet.

Aumentado also announced that the road connecting barangays Mahayag and San Miguel, both in Danao will be concreted this year with an allocation of ₱75 million also from DPWH. 

The amount cannot yet cover the whole stretch so that additional funds will be allocated to complete the project.

Aside from Gonzaga and the barangay officials, ex-oficioBoard Member Gloria Gementiza also attended the assembly.
