The Liberal Party took complete control in the provincial board with the entry of a new ex-oficio board member identified with the camp of Gov. Edgar M. Chatto.

SangguniangKabataan (SK) Provincial Federation President Christian Victor C. Bolos III on Friday made his historic first SangguniangPanlalawigan (SP) presence and opened the door of what he calls “the office of every young person in Bohol.”

Counted in the majority are Board Members BenjieArcamo,  AbelDamalerio, Ricky Masamayor, AgapitoAvenido, Kristine Alexie Tutor, ElpidioJala and ex-oficio member Romulo Cepedoza. 

An opposition seat occupied by resigned Board Member Nino Rey Boniel is still vacant. The opposition counts Board Mermbers Tomas Abapo Jr., ex-oficio Board Member Gloria Gementiza representing the Philippine Councilors League (PCL) and Board Member Victor DionisioBalite.

In his inaugural speech, the youthful but articulate new member of the provincial board from Dauis cited Gov. Edgar Chatto whose service to youth through his “commitment to education” has so inspired him.

A purpose-driven young man who so values education---and public service as a continuing learning, the SK-Bohol head saw in himself “a fruit of a Chatto seed.”   

Now the new chairman of the SP Committee on Youth and Sports Development, the 21-year-old Bolos currently pursues his education course at the Bohol Island State University (BISU).

A law principally authored by Chatto while he was congressman coincidentally created the BISU, the first and only state university in Bohol.

Bolos considered himself a servant leader to the youth, with his initiatives as the SK-Bohol head drawn from the “needs” of the young sector.

His term as the ex-officio member of the province’s highest legislature representing the youth will be manifesting the “creativity” of the youth.

The SK-Bohol space at capitol is “not just my office” but “our office---the office of every young person in Bohol,” he said.

Bolos was warmly welcomed by his elder SP colleagues led by their presiding officer, Vice Gov. DionisioBalite.

Bolos asked his fellow young people to “practice to dare” themselves to do what are beyond and more than the usual.

According to Bolos, the SK is much more than about sports and pageantry, citing today’s pressing concerns like substance abuse.

But he will not turn his back on sports and socio-cultural activities because they create healthy and personal development engagements.

Bolos thought of a specialized program that will also address environmental concerns.
The youth official will build a dynamic young sector that “turns peaceful dialogue, understanding and acceptance into a daily practice and a functional lifestyle.”
Youth for peace should not be a “mere option in the face of conflict,” he said, “see(ing) peace as a way of life and order as its product.”

A lot of young people find it hard to get job, like the fresh graduates of allied medical science or nursing, and Bolos would wish to tap them for compassionate service to those who truly need them.

They can gain work experience through such program as the province’s HEAT-IT Caravan, which has so impressed the SK official.

Also, he thought of a youth program for media---and social media---literacy, print journalism and broadcasting, as well as information communications technology and skills development.

Admitting his limits, a gesture of honesty and humility, did stun the members of the provincial board ahead of him as Bolos said, “I wish to learn from you.”

The SK provincial head pleaded further, “I implore your counsel and understanding as I learn the ropes of lawmaking.”(VenreboArigo)
