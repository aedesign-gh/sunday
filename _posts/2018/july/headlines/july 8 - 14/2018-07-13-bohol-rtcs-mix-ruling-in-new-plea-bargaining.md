Due to this predicament, Judge Suceso A. Arcamo, executive judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Bohol told this paper in an exclusive interview that he will call for a conference among all RTC judges here in order to solve the impasse.

Arcamo himself granted plea bargaining in drug cases handled by his sala in RTC Branch 47 and in RTC Branch 49 being the acting presiding judge.

Earlier, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision in Sec. 23 of Republic Act 9165 otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 prohibiting plea bargaining as invalid.

In en banc decision in the case of Salvador Estipona Jr. vs. Hon. Frank E. Lobrigo in GR No. 226679 last August 15, 2017, the High Tribunal declared “as invalid the prohibition against plea bargaining on drug cases until and unless it is made part of the rules of procedure through an administrative circular duly issued for the purpose”.

Along this line, it then issued a circular on plea bargaining on drug cases in the first week of May this year.

However, the prosecution office is still awaiting for the circular to be issued by the Department of Justice based on the ruling on the Estipona case.

The drugs court in Bohol, RTC Branch 4 presided over by Judge SisinioVirtudazo will only granted plead bargaining in drug cases if there is no opposition from the prosecution office.

While awaiting for the DOJ guidelines, the city prosecution office will not consent to plea bargaining in drug cases pending before RTC Branch 4.
But a provincial prosecutor assigned in the sala of Virtudazo, Pros. Roberto Maligmat, did not object to plea bargaining in drug cases assigned to the provincial prosecution office.

While Judge Jorge D. Cabalit of RTC Branch 48 orders the suspension of the hearing of drug cases while awaiting for the DOJ guidelines.

Meanwhile, Judge Daray of RTC Branch 50 based in Talibon town already allowed plea bargaining despite the objection from the provincial prosecutor based on three grounds: there is already a circular issued by the Supreme Court, it is favourable to the accused and involving to the right of speedy trial.

RTC Branch 51 in Carmen still has no presiding judge after the retirement of Judge Patsita Sarmiento-Gamutan.
