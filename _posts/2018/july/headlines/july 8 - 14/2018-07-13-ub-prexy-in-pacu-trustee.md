The group was formally organized in 1932 as the Association of Filipino Private Universities and Colleges (AFPUC). Its primordial purpose is to set higher standards for private educational institutions and to promote the interests of private education in the country. In 1947, AFCU changed its name to Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU). Since then, the association has remained steadfast in its mission to provide quality education among its member schools. (labboncales)
