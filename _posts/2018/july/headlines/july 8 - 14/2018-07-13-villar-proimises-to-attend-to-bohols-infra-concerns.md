Sec. Mark Villar of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) made a lightning visit here on Thursday.

This after Pres. Duterte ordered the DPWH secretary to immediately check the concerns raised by the Boholanos on delayed projects and the road re-blocking called by a board member as a waste of funds and the height of stupidity.

During his quick visit, Villarsaid he will call the attention of problematic project contractors as he assured to keep eye on Bohol ‘s infrastructure concerns.

He told his regional and district heads to update the public of the progress or status of the different projects.

The DPWH field offices can provide both essential and necessary information through the members of the media whom the secretary calls “our connection” to the people.
Escorted by Gov. Edgar Chatto, Villar inspected the construction of the entirely new bridge along the national highway in Anislag, Maribojoc which is set for completion this October. 

The bridge structure itself has been finished and the current works focus on the approaches, as in the case of the bridge projects in Hinawanan and Palo in Loay, according to DPWH Reg’l. Dir. Ador Canlas.

These are still rehabilitation works assisted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) following the strongest earthquake to hit the island-province.
The base of the road approaches of the Anisagbridge alone collapsed by two meters and the ground had yet to stabilize before the reconstruction. 

The Maribojoc and Loay bridges are under one project package worth P139.346 million.
Including their approaches, the Hinawanan and Palo bridges are both to be finished this August.

Canlas briefed Villar on the projects’ current accomplishment rates and target completion dates also in the presence of First District Rep. Rene Relampagos and Third District Rep. Arthur Yap.

Both Relampagos and Yap joined Chatto in meeting Villar at the Tagbilaran City airport and escorting the secretary to the Maribojoc project site, where the briefing was held.

The secretary was also updated on the construction of Damiao, Hunan and Bateria bridges, all in Buenavista, under a separate project package.

Meanwhile, the Makapikobridge along the Balilihan-Hanopol-Batuan national road will already be opened and used by October, this year, according to the DPWH.
Further, the DPWH said the contractor is mobilizing equipment for the new Clarin bridge construction in Loay and civil works “should begin soon until full project completion in October of 2019.”

“Rest assured that Bohol’s infrastructure needs are given proper attention,” Villar said in the Maribojoc briefing also attended by his three district engineers in Bohol.
The DPWH First, Second and Third Engineering Districts are headed by Engr. Francis Antonio Flores, Engr. Mario Montejo and Engr. ConcordioLangomez, respectively. 

In cases of problematic or “questionable” projects, “I myself will talk to the contractors,” the secretary said in front of the governor and other Bohol officials.

REBLOCKING

Villar was in Cebu and then proceeded to Bohol Thursday afternoon or a week after the local media raised to Pres. Rodrigo Duterte the reblocking or reconstruction of roads minus proper DPWH advisory or sufficient prior information.

Road reblocking is a national concern as it is done by the DPWH elsewhere in the country to permanently correct defective sections of national roads that otherwise still look strong and good to the naked eye.

“I’m here to review your concerns,” said Villar, who brought along with him Usec. Robert Bernardo and Project Engr. Bernardo Austria.

The reblocking or reconstruction of defective portions of national roads is first identified based on the road condition (Rocon) survey,

It is likewise in observance of the international road roughness index, according to the DPWH.

Reblocking or reconstruction is distinct and separate from another road asset preservation scheme which is road preventive maintenance through asphalt overlay.
After the Rocon, its result will be validated to identify if the road portion affected is for reblocking or reconstruction and how much fund is needed.

The current reblocking/reconstruction activities in Bohol by the DPWH are based on the programs submitted to the central office as early as 2016.

However, their allocations were released only this year---and almost simultaneously.
This helps explain why such road rehabilitation works have been observed being undertaken almost simultaneously, too. 

Also, reblocking and reconstruction have been done on roads likewise affected by the strong earthquake, even if the defects could not be seen or detected on the surface.
There are sections of national roads which were bored, holed and then appeared “abandoned,” but the DPWH officials explained these were done technically to ease road excavation.

If not bored and holed, the mechanical pressure and vibration of excavating or scraping the concrete slabs of the defective road will affect the other lane, which is of good condition and not for reblocking.

These were also explained by the district engineers when they were called by the governor to answer media questions during Chatto’s “Kita ugAngGobernador” program at the Governor’s Mansion on Friday.

Chatto told the DPWH engineers to also install most appropriate signages, which should expand the information of the details of works like the cause of reblocking.

Chatto much earlier raised to the attention of the DPWH, including the regional office, varied concerns affecting roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects implemented by the agency.

The mess will be fixed, and “you have my assurance,” Villar said. (with reports from VenArigo)
