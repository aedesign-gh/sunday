The much-ballyhooed return of Nila Montero as chief executive of Panglao is more of a fake news, thus declared Mayor Pedro Fuertes last week.

In an exclusive interview over Station DYTR, Fuertes said he found out that two casual employees identified with Montero posted the announcement at the board of the municipal hall claiming the return of Montero as town mayor.

This after she was dismissed by the Ombudsman for various illegal acts in relation to her being the town mayor.

One of which is the appointment of several party mates in the last local election within the election ban.

Reports said Montero is still facing eight criminal cases before the Sandiganbayan after her dismissal.

The rap against Montero was initiated by Ago Cloribel, Montero’s arch enemy in Panglao politics.

Fuertes did not identify the two casual employees but said he will initiate a full blown investigation against the employees.

The announcement posted by the casual employees was to the effect that all is set for the re-assumption of Montero as town mayor of Panglao.
