Tagbilaran became a chartered city on July 1, 1966 by virtue of Republic Act 4660.
This is momentous because the city is now governed by its own charter where the local leaders have more local control over its affairs. 

By its own charter, the city has achieved a significant level of development through the years, spurred also by the increased internal revenue allotment (IRA) from the national government. 

Tagbilaran, formerly called San Jose de Tagbilaran, was established as a separate municipality from Baclayon last February 9, 1742 by virtue of a decree by Spanish Governor General Gaspar dela Torre.
