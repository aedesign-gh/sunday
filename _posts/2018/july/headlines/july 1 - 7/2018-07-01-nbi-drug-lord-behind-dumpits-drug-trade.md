Drug lord behind Dumpit’s trade?

The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Bohol disclosed last week that a drug lord is behind SPO1 Adonis Dumpit’s illegal drug business here.

However, NBI through its chief, Atty. RennanOliva not identify the drug lord. 

A composite team of police and NBI operatives and other operatives shot SP01 Adonis Dumpit, 55, to death, at the back portion of LindavilleSubdivisio Phase II, just a few meters from his house in barangay San Isidro in this city at past 8 in the morning last Thursday.

NBI defended their action against former Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmena’s close-in aide as legitimate as something like “interception.”

Recovered from Dumpit’s possession were 15 big sachets of alleged shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride), a .45 caliber pistol and his red big motorbike. The firearm and the motorbike were not his but of another name, NBI said.

Oliva said that a certain police officer Jonathan Argao appeared to be threatened by Dumpit when the former declined to the latter’s demand.

Oliva said that Dumpit wanted that the charge against a drug suspect identified as one Sergio Tahanlangit be downgraded.

But the charge against Tahanlangit has already been filed.

A source told this paper that Dumpit controlled the drug distribution in Lindaville, Tiptip and even in Panglao ad Corella towns.

Reports said Tahanlangit even bragged that he will continue to sell illegal drugs even if confined at the city jail under the protection of Dumpit.

After the conflict with Argao, the latter’s car was fired upon. It was not known if the culprit was Dumpit.

The incident (Argao’s car fired upon) was recorded but it did not come out in the news.

What appeared to be rift between Dumpit and Argao was reported to the higher-ups of the police and other authorities that led to the “interception” of Dumpit.

A media personality (name withheld) told this writer that he was indeed threatened by Dumpit for unknown reason.

This alarms the media practitioners in Bohol for their safety.

Media, like officials of the barangay where the drug operation is conducted, are needed only to witness the inventory, said a fellow writer in interview.

Meanwhile, Punong Barangay BebotBudlongof San Isidro District this city said in a radio interview asked his constituents here not to cause panic after the bloody incident as this is an “isolated case.”

Dumpit’s remains were brought to Cebu City where Mayor Osmena visited his wake. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
