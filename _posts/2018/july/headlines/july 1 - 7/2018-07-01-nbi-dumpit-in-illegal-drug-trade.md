NBI: Dumpit in illegal drug trade

SPO2 ADONIS DUMPIT PATAY HUMAN NISUKOL SA PULIS UG NBI.

LOOK: Multi-awarded policeman SPO2 Adonis Dumpit was killed in a joint operation by agents of National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Bohol and Police Regional Intelligence Division in Central Visayas (RID-7) n Barangay San Isidro, Tagbilaran City, Bohol at past 8 a.m, Wednesday (June 27).

NBI-Bohol classified Dumpit as a high-level drug pusher and protector.

Initial investigation showed that Dumpit had to deliver illegal drugs from Cabawan District in Tagbilaran City today.

Dumpit was released from the Leyte Regional Prison in Abuyog, Leyte last May 2016, after the Court of Appeals allowed him to post a P250,000-bail pending the resolution of his appeal.

The sharpshooter policeman has served his minimum prison term of six years and exhibited good behavior during his incarceration.

Dumpit, then with the Cebu City Police Office (CCPO), was convicted of homicide by the Regional Trial Court in Cebu City for killing a 17-year-old suspected robber in Cebu City. / Photo courtesy of Leo Udtuhan and LitoTecson

UPDATE: Regional Intelligence Division-7 chief Senior Supt. Remus Medina clarifies that SPO1 Adonis Dumpit was NOT the subject of a buy-bust operation. He said authorities only “intercepted” Dumpit after receiving information that he was bringing drugs while driving his motorcycle. This is contrary to the content of the spot report relayed by the police to the media earlier, which said it was a buy-bust operation. Medina said authorities flagged down Dumpit but the latter did not heed and instead shot it out with them. Dumpit fell to the ground about 100 meters from the house he was renting in Barangay San Isidro, Tagbilaran City. Here are some of the photos of the scene. | via RicObedencio and Camille Pateres

DUMPIT'S CORPSE ALREADY IN CEBU CITY
The remains of SPO1 Adonis Dumpit were shipped by his original family to Cebu City this morning for a wake in two days or less.

This was according to the killed cop's partner, Maria Ella Amores, in a conversation with this writer this morning.

Dumpit's marriage to his first wife had been annulled.

His corpse will be cremated and brought to his birthplace of Banganga in Davao Oriental.
