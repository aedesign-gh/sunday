Duterte warns mayors in speech to v-mayors

PANGLAO.-Pres.Duterte warned municipal mayors to do good or face the consequences in his message to the vice-mayors’ league here on Thursday.

Duterte visited Bohol Thursday to keynote the 25thVice-Mayor’s League of the Philippines (VMLP) annual convention held at posh Bellevue Resort in this town.

‘Yung sa mayor langpo. Ito ultimatum na for them ‘no if they don’t shape up”.

The President said during a media interview after the program that he is not satisfied by the way they have responded to the problem and sees that there has always been a rise in the municipalities throughout the Philippines to those mayors who do not want to --- who do not want to do their duties.

“Nonchalant attitude. Aba hindipwede ‘yang ganun. If that is the way how you behave as a mayor, you better go out, “ he said.

If they don’t do their function well, Duterte said “Eh di ibigaymoditosamga vice mayors. Marami ‘yansilanaghihintay.”

Duterte clarified he did not mean that if ever the mayors didn’t do their duties well especially the campaign against illegal drugs in their respective turfs he would replace them with police officers.

“If ang mayor cannot enforce law and order in their municipalities, I will just withdraw his deputization”, Duterte said.

“They are deputies of the NAPOLCOM eh. That is the --- they have the guidance and direction. Ngayon, kunghindika mag --- tatanggalinko 'yan, 'yung power of --- over the police”, he added.

He said that if the mayors just sit there because they’re afraid of drug pushers “all you have to do is just to tell me sinongkalabanmo, sinong nag-harass sainyona gusto mong --- we'll solve the problem, we'll solve the problem together.”

In his almost an hour of speech,Duterte said that he called the mayors in a meeting and bluntly told then“Do not --- do not go into drugs kaymaski mayor kayo, papatayinkotalaga kayo.” Prangka-prangka.”

He said he ordered the DILG to conduct an audit, saying “kayongmga mayors, pinapa-audit kokay… Alammokungbakitsinasabikonasainyoevenas he also addressing to the vice mayors as they also run for mayor in the coming elections.

“Sabikokay General Año (DILG acting secretary), “i-audit monga ‘yansila, sir.” And sabiko, ’yungmga mayors nahindimakapag-control ng crime and every now and then may buy-bust dito, buy-bust doon. Kung saan-saanna lang. At it numbers like 20 buy-bust operations a day, eh tatanggalinmo ‘yang pulisniya. Ilagayko ‘yungpulisko. Ikawna ‘yung mayor”, the President bared.
 
“Insofar as law and order, you are the mayor. Huwagmonangpansinin ‘yang mayor na ‘yan. Tanggalin ‘yan and I will file a case against you. Serious neglect of duty or simple neglect, or gross ignorance of the law or oppression, or simply doing nothing.”

“If you are not doing anything, I will file charges against you and sabihinkokayAño, “i-dismiss mo.” You recommend for the dismissal and I will sign it.”

He said “what I want you to do. Just enforce the law. You are there to enforce the law. Your mayor --- Alammo, the long and short of our… You read your oath of office.” 

He also urged them “protect the people and preserve the Republic of the Philippines as a nation. ‘Yan lang.” (rvo)
