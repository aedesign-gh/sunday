Villar to check road re-blocking
 
PANGLAO.- Pres.Duterte assured Boholanos on Thursday over the on-going road re-blocking project of Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) that generated public criticism.

The President said he will ask DPWH Sec. MarkVillar to come over and explain to the people as the public deserve an explanation from the government.

Duterte breezed into town to keynote to 25th national convention of the Vice-Mayors’ League of Philippines (VMLP) hosted by the province. 

The activity was held at Bellevue Resort of this town, where Tagbilaran City Vice-Mayor Jose Antonio Velosowas the convention director.

He was accompanied by his special assistant to President (SAP) Christopher “Bong” Go and political adviser former MMDA chair and Tagaytay City Mayor Francis Tolentino.
The President was welcomed by Gov. Edgar Chatto, Reps. Rene Relampagos, ArisAumentado and Arthur C. Yap, Panglao Mayor Pedro Fuertes at the resort’s pavilion where the convention was held and attended by some 600 vice-mayors of the municipalities and cities in the country.

It is his second visit after he became President following last year’s security briefing over Abu Sayyaf incursion and fourth since 2015 when he guested in a school as commencement speaker and in 2016 to campaign.

Duterte however admitted that he is not a technical person to explain about the road project.

Duterte added that “I don't know, you had a very strong earthquake here. 

Nanghinayangakosamga --- 'yungmga buildings namatagalna”, apparently referring to centuries-old churches in some municipalities badly affected by the earthquake.

Two of those (churches) – in Maribojoc and Loon towns --- were in total ruins following the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that shook Bohol in October 15, 2013.

“Ilagyudnanggub-on. Mao na’yakongpagkahibalo. (They will really bulldoze it as far as I know.) Duterte said.

Recently, veteran provincial Board Member Atty. Tomas D, Abapo, Jr. described the re-blocking as a “waste of funds.”

On Friday, district engineers of DPWH engineering 1, 2 and 3 were no-show during the board’s committee of the whole meeting.

They only sent their respective representatives who were grilled before the SangguniangPanlalawigan’s committee meeting. (rvo)
