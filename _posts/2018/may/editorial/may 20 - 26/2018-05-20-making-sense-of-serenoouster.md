The Supreme Court is the highest judicial tribunal of the Republic of the Philippines and is the final arbiter of all legal and constitutional issues.

The High Tribunaldecided with a 9-5 majority vote that the Quo Warranto petition is the best remedy on the issues surrounding Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno’s appointment as Chief Justice.

In a similar 9-5 decision, it declared that Sereno violated the constitution for failing to file her SALNs. 

And finally, by a majority vote of 8-6, it granted the Quo Warranto petition to nullify the appointment of Sereno, thereby ousting her as Chief Justice effective immediately.
It is such a painful day for Sereno and her supporters consisting of LP politicians, leftist activists, militant students, some members of the clergy, etc. 

She earlier made press releases about her legal defenses on the impeachment case filed against her at the House of Representatives. She was preparing for her day in the Senate court which was why she claimed she took that “wellness leave” (although some officials at the Supreme Court said she was actually forced to take an indefinite leave of absence).

So the Supreme Court decision to oust her even before the House made a ruling on her impeachment case was seen by many as anti-climactic. It deprived telenovela lovers of an upcoming suspense drama series waiting to unfold at the Senate impeachment trial. A painful slap on the face of Sereno as it rendered all her preparations useless. She lost even before her battle began. It’s like we were not able to see how good the doctor was because the patient was already dead on arrival.

To explain better the difference between a quo warranto and an impeachment, I would like to cite an example of a government project bidding. An impeachment is like a contractor having won the bid but the active contract had to be terminated because of the contractor’s failure to deliver and fulfill his commitments as stipulated in the contract. 

A quo warranto petition is like declaring that the contractor was not eligible to participate in that bidding because of some lacking qualifications and therefore must have been disqualified and the contract that was awarded to him must be deemed null and void.

I hope this simple and clear explanation will already enlighten the minds of legal experts who are insisting that impeachment is the only way to remove Sereno and nothing else.

The solicitor general has the authority and the duty to file quo warranto cases against any official for that matter and this can be done without any prescription limitation contrary to what “experts” say. Even former Associate Justice Nachura said the prescription rule doesn’t apply when the government is the complainant. He added that even in criminal cases the prescription starts from the time the crime was discovered. Not from the time it was committed.

And in the case of Sereno, it was during the House Committee impeachment hearing that it was found out that even if the JBC required at least 10 SALNs to be submitted by the Chief Justice applicants, Sereno submitted around only two SALNs. Former JBC Chair Associate Justice Peralta was even surprised about this fact. He said that had he known that Sereno didn’t comply with this requirement, he would not have included her in the shortlist.

So the Sereno ouster is a vindication for fellow associate justices De Castro and Carpio who submitted more than 10 SALNs but were not selected because perhaps they were not former President PNoy’s lackeys. Justice has finally been served for the late Chief Justice Renato Corona who was impeached because of his SALN issues but only to be replaced later on by someone who didn’t submit SALNs.

Had the Quo warranto petition been rejected by the SC en banc, things could have gotten complicated. Because this would mean Sereno’s ouster would now be the task of Congress which is dominated by the President’s allies. It may add political colors and cast dark shadows on the legitimacy of her removal. Personally I am happy that this case was decided upon by the likes of Jardeleza and De Castro and other seasoned Justices rather than have Sereno convicted by a Tito Sotto, Nancy Binay or a Manny Pacquiao.

But our highest judicial body, without any pressure nor coercion from the executive and legislative branches of government, made its own independent decision to remove its own Chief Justice mainly based on the merits of this case. It is a great beautiful moment for our Philippine Judiciary.

Justice has prevailed. The crisis has ended. The President can go full steam ahead with more reforms in our government and in our country as a whole.

Tomorrow is a new bright beginning. (Willie Ramasola)
