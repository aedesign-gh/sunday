The Barangay and SK elections held last week have taught us lessons that could not be contained in any storage house or facility of San Miguel Corporation, Alturas Group of Companies or the Bohol Quality Corporation.  Sad to say the lessons make us gnash our teeth and fear for the future of this country (Bohol particularly) and its people. 
Many opinion and column writers may fail to write about it having in mind “what else is new about Philippine elections?,” and given the prominence of news of national interest like the ouster of Chief Justice Cereno by the Supreme Court in a quo warranto case.  But just the same the significance of the conduct and behaviour of voters in last Monday’s elections deserve the attention of the people.  Cereno’s ouster by her colleagues remains a legal issue and can be addressed legally under the Constitution.  But the issue of last Monday’s and future elections can only be addressed by the people themselves.

The last Monday’s election of Barangay and SK officials has opened the eyes of both veteran and budding politicians,the church, and advocates of clean, just and honest elections. One lesson that stood tall is that money or the lack of it continues to determine the results of elections, at least per our experience in Bohol.How else can we conclude given the reports of massive vote buying (if the giving of inagayan is one) before and during election day and those proclaimed winners after all votes were counted.

Here in Tagbilaran City, as elsewhere in the province, there were reports that the buying rate went as high as P2,000 to P3,000.  “For Barangay Officials election?,” you might ask.  Well yes. That was the rate that was going before in municipal, provincial, and congressional elections.  So what will the rate be in the coming mid-term elections next year? I don’t want to speculate.

That doesn’t prove that those who gave inangayan won the election as the givers were not identified, you might say.  Oh yes.  Why don’t you see who in your barangay won the election.  In my barangay, those who I personally know gave money have all won the election. Those who thought that they were known by everybody in the barangay and were qualified to hold office and therefore did not give out money did not make it to the winning list.  That includes my barangay captain who only ran now as barangay kagawad but did not give money to the voters.  He landed in the 13th position for Kagawad.  Unfortunately only the 1st to the 7th position were proclaimed winners.

Now where does this put the other qualified but poor leaders in the coming elections?  Given this measure of “winnability” in Bohol elections, how can we eliminate the motive of elected leaders to engage in corrupt practices once elected? How can we encourage poor but more qualified leaders to seek elective positions in government?  What new strategies or new courses of actions will the church and the advocates of clean, just and honest elections now take to persuade voters from saying no to offers of inangayan?  
The answer to all these lie in our electorate who go to the poles to vote on Election Day.  The strategy to tell them to accept the inangayan but vote only for those thy feel will serve well has not worked and is not working and most probably will not work at all.
There is hope however to change our culture of election as proven in Candijay but this will need the genuine cooperation of both candidates and voters alike.  I was told that inCandijay during the last elections according to the news broadcast of ABS-CBN, the town had this slogan during the Barangay and SK Elections “Kon Way Hinatagay, LimpyoangPiniliay.” No one gave out inangayan but the voters still trooped to the polling place and voted for their candidates they thought deserve their trust.  So it can be done after all if everyone cooperates.

There are 12 months left before the next mid-term elections.  There is still time to organize and strategize to include the Candijay experience.  The problem is who will act as convenor.  I will ask our dear readers to please suggest who will act as convenor – the church, civil society, the media, business and civic organizations. I will be happy to participate for the love of Bohol.(For comments and suggestions, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
