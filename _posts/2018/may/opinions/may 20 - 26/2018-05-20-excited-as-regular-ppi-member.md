Excited as regular PPI member

Pardon us our dear readers as we have to set aside our comments to the city traffic, the encounter between the military and the communist rebels in Bilar town last week, the massive repair of concrete roads in the first district and the state of health of our governor after he was admitted again at Chonghua Hospital in Cebu City the other week.
All these will have to take the second seat we are very excited to join the 22nd National Press Forum in Manila this week and be bestowed with a regular membership of the Philippine Press Institute (PPI), the national organization of newspapers since 1964.

We conferred with PPI Executive Director Ariel Sebellino last week and he approved our registration for the PPI national assembly starting on May 24 at Hotel Jen in Roxas Boulevard.

Our regular PPI membership is a quantum lift for this young community newspaper which has been struggling hard to survive as we feel being orphaned added to the fact that we are receiving attacks and harassments from both sides.

During the PPI seminar held in Cebu City last year, we sent our youngest child to join the activity and she was received by the staff. The activity was focused on distractive activity against the environment.

This week, PPI will host the general assembly under the theme “Reclaiming the Value of Journalism: In An Era When Clickbait is King”.

Our probationary membership last year earned us the opportunity to make friends and connections in the fourth estate and allow us to know the manuever in order to stay alive in the media enterprise.

We do hope that as we enter into another phase of our membership in the PPI, Bohol Sunday News will be able to expand its capability of serving the Boholano community as we see bright prospects in the future.

So, to our friends and enemies, just stay tune as we continue to embark on this new mileage in this era of media survival.

As we said, we are comfortable of just being No. 3 or even No. 4 in the ranking as we never intend to compete with those in the No. 1 or No. 2.

So just sit down, relax and enjoy reading the issues of the Bohol Sunday News, your independent Boholano newspaper.
