SUNDAY REFLECTION

Passing the Baton

Ascension Sunday(cycle B)
Readings:	Acts1:1-11; Eph1:17-23; Mt 16:15-20

According to the dictionary, a “baton” means a cudgel or truncheon; a narrow heraldic bend; a slender rod with which a leader directs a band or orchestra; a hollow cylinder carried by each member of a relay team and passed to the succeeding runner; a hollow metal rod with a weighted bulb at one or both ends that is flourished by a drum major or drum majorette; a staff borne as a symbol of office.

The expression “passing the baton” means passing a job and responsibility on to another.

The Feast of the Ascension of the Lord might be compared to the passing of the baton.  On this day 2,000 years ago, Jesus passed the baton of responsibility for the Kingdom of God to his followers.  Jesus commissioned them to complete the work he had begun.

In this Feast of the Ascension of the Lord, we are not celebrating the Lord’s departure from this world.  How can somebody show joy when a friend goes away?  We cannot be happy when someone we love and admire leaves us.  The Feast of the Ascension is trying to teach us a deep lesson.

In today’s first reading, Luke describes the Ascension and how Jesus tells his disciples to be his witnesses to the ends of the earth.  And in the gospel reading from Mark Jesus tells his disciples to be his teachers to the world.  Mark does not describe the Ascension of Jesus as Luke does.

The meeting of the Risen Lord takes place on a mountain.  We have to remember that the mountain is a place where God manifests himself (e.g., Moses and Elijah).  Matthew uses the same image and places Jesus on a mountain every time he has to say or do something very important.  With this in mind, it would be easy for us to understand the meaning of the scene we read in the scene today: the sending of the disciples (the passing of the baton to the disciples) into the whole world is an extremely important event.

The apostles were given the mission to evangelize the whole world.  Jesus speaks of his authority. He was sent by the Father to bring the message of salvation to all the world.  He now entrusts this proclamation to his disciples.  They will have to bring the Good News to all humankind, and in order to do this they are given Jesus’ on powers.  The Church has to make Christ present in the world.

We are to become witnesses and teachers in our homes, our work places, and other schools.  It is to carry out Jesus’ commission wherever we find ourselves.  We do it simply by making an effort to become the kind of person God the Father made us to be.  We do it simply by making an effort to become the kind of person Jesus teaches us to be.  We do it simply be making an effort to become the kind of person the Holy Spirit inspires us to be.  We witness to Jesus and teach others by our love when others need us, by our patience when others annoy us, by our forgiveness when other wrong us, and by our perseverance when we feel like quitting.

Our lives speak more eloquently than our lips do when it comes to witnessing and teaching.  Witnessing to Jesus and teaching others about him is simply sharing with them our own faith and love.

The message of the Ascension is a simple one:

Jesus invites us to take from his hand the baton he received from his Father and to continue the work that his Father gave him to do on earth.
