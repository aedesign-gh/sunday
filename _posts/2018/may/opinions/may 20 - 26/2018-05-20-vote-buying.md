Vote Buying

Vote buying was rampant and massive during the joint barangay and SK (SangguniangKabataan) elections last Monday. Candidates for the barangay officials were the most active in vote buying because they have the means and machineries. Vote buying is now the rule than an exception that if you do not do it you are considered as poor.

In the olden times candidates employ all means of trickery just to win in an election. Nowadays these trickeries had been checked up by law. Vote buying was the lesser evil as it is generally discreet. It is a sort of an investment which has to be recouped later on by the winner. And woe are those who buy votes and lost, they have to lick their ignominy.

The court division of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) is under fire lately because its wheel of justice turns so slow. There are so many complaints of vote buying, but no one has been prosecuted yet. Many had signed affidavits as witnesses for vote buying, yet the cases do not prosper.

What are one of the reasons why these cases do not go beyond the first base? Foremost are the complainants themselves, who are usually the losers, lost desire to pursue the case. The flames of fiery motions are strong as an aftermath of an elections, but smolders and dies as the days wore on.

And the witnesses after being talked out by their leaders and the defendant himself, suddenly lost courage to stand on the witnessâ€™s stand.They also realized how onerous it is to be involved in a court case.

Candidates in a covenant with God and the law that they will refrain from vote buying, do otherwise to outsmart their opponents. It is so shameless because their covenant were signed infront of a parish priest and their constituents. Many people dream that vote buying will end. But when and how? But is it here to stay until the end of time?
