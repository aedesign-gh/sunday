The Gospel of Jesus Christ (May 20, 2018-Sunday) Mark 8:1-10”In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them, "I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat. "If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance.

These people stayed with Jesus day and night for three days, no doubt enjoying his messages as well as expecting to see miracles. 

The people who followed Jesus were out of supply for their survival. Jesus saw their situation in life and their personal needs. 

This is Jesus whom I preach every now and then who can see our necessities in life. He has never changed. Hebrews 3:8”Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. The only move you can do is to come to him no matter what. The people refused to go home although they knew their insufficiency materially because of their happiness within that this world could not give.”

This is true, only in God we can find genuine happiness. Not money and earthly possessions in life. People gambled everything just to follow Jesus in the wilderness. There were rewarded by Jesus in forms of healing, miracles and the food they had eaten. 
To be good it pays.
