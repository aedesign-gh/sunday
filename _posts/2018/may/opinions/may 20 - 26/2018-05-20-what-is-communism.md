What is communism?
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

This has occupied the front pages of our local newspapers again; reports of gunfights between government soldiers and armed elements of the Communist New People’s Army.

When President Rodrigo Dutertefirst came to office he reportedly reserved at least four departments for the Communist Party of the Philippines or its recommendees. Then, he appointed the following:Rafael Mariano for Agrarian Reform, Judy Taguiwalo for Social Welfare, and Joel Maglungsod for Labor. Mariano and Taguiwalo have since been booted out of office when the President’s relationship with alleged CPP founder, Jose Maria Sison, became sour. Silvestre Bello III used to be the Chairman of Bayan Mindanao when I was a student activist, and Bohol’s very own LeoncioEvasco, Jr. used to be a rebel chaplain of sorts. But decades have passed and people could change.

But what is communism? Google describes it as“a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs”.

It is a political theory. Yes, just a theory. There is no existing communist country in the world today. There are only countries ruled by communist political parties (that means, political parties trying to make their countries attain a communist stage) such as China, North Korea, and Cuba. But they are not yet communist societies. In these countries, there are no elections like ours. There is only one party, that is, the Communist Party, and nothing else. Anyone who wants to work in those governments must become members of their Communist Party.

Communismwas derived from Karl Marx. He was the German philosopher who said that religion is the opium of the people, like shabu, marijuana or ecstasy. Marx said religions serve to make the people forget their problems without solving them. He was an atheist; does not believe in God.

Communism advocates class war. What is class war? In simplistic terms, it means that communist advocates believe that in order to attain equality in society, the poor must wage a war against the rich. And if they feel it is necessary, they can kill the rich, or even kill their fellow poor if they believe that they are conniving with the rich.

In 2007, however, President Gloria Arroyo signed Amnesty Proclamation 1377 for members of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA); other communist rebel groups; and their umbrella organization, the National Democratic Front. The amnesty covered the crime of rebellion and all other crimes "in pursuit of political beliefs," but not including crimes against chastity, rape, torture, kidnapping for ransom, use and trafficking of illegal drugs and other crimes for personal ends and violations of international law or convention and protocols "even if alleged to have been committed in pursuit of political beliefs". In other words, under such proclamation, it is not illegal to be a communist. It is illegal though to take up arms against the government.
