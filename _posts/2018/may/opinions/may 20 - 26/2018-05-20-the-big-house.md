The Big House

The other day my friend who is already an American citizen came home to have a house blessing of his new house. By Filipino standard or American standards as what his sister told me, his house was by far a big one. As he showed me around  what came to my mind were the astronomical electrical and water bills that came with a large house.

It had a large guest room with two king size beds complete with a spacious bathroom and a toilet in one. It had cancelled lockers all around the room to minimize clutters. His bedroom was large enough to house an entire family of five. The 110 volts 80 inches tv which he brought home occupied one of the walls of his room. His house had electricity of 220 and 110 voltages. The 110 volts were for the appliances he brought from America. 

He stayed in his house for only a short time; the longest is one month because most of the year he was in America. I do not know if he will stay for good in our town if he retires.

His house reminded me of a house on the hills of Maribojoc. Before the Bohol Earthquake of Oct. 2013, I had combed the hills of my town every weekend searching for this house because its lights that shone brightly at night as seen from the second floor of my house intrigued me so much that it compelled me to find its location.

When I found the house, I knew it was the one I had been looking for. It was located on the slope of a hill overlooking the town proper of my town. It was raised on posts as the vogue of the olden times. 

Evidently the house was owned by a rich one. It was made of hard wood.  The carvings on the window sills, on the posts, the balusters, on the ventanillas, the shell windows were intricately executed. To bring these materials up to this hill means the owner had a lot of money.

We called out if there was anybody home. Momentarily it was opened by an old woman in her 70s. We explained why we were there. She was more than willing to let us see her house and asked us to come up. She opened the sliding shell windows by pushing sideways. 
The lights that came in revealed a shiny floor which was alternated with black and yellow hardwood. The house was like a museum considering the antique tables and sala set, the black and white pictures in oval frames hang on a hardwood wall.

We asked how often she cleaned the house. She answered once a month because the dust in the lowlands do not reach her house and she was all alone by herself.

The woman said it is not advisable to build a big house because you spend so much for it and in the end it will become an empty nest. She related her parents built the house in the

1920s. They were a large family, but her siblings left their house one by one as they looked for their own fortune. Being the youngest, she was left to take care of the house.

She married and raised a large family. Like her siblings, her children left one by one to fly above the horizon in search for that proverbial pot of gold. 

According to her had she known beforehand that she would be alone in a large house in the twilight of her years, she would not have married. 

An ostentatious house reflects the vanity of their owners. A house without a clutter is only in the pages of a magazine. A functional house is full of clutter: a shirt on the backrest of chair, a discarded shoe on the corner which could not be thrown for sentimental reasons, nails on walls for shirts and trousers to hang. A house is a dead investment. Ultimately it will be an empty nest in the end. The story of the woman from the hills is a common story of all.
