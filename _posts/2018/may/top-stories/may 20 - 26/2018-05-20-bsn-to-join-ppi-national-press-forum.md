The Bohol Sunday News will be joining the 22nd National Press Forum and general assembly by the Philippine Press Institute (PPI) on May 24 to 26 at Hotel Jen, formerly Traders Hotel in Manila.

PPI Executive Director Ariel Sebellino said only one slot for the official representative of the member-newspaper. 

Extra participant will be paying based on hotel's computation for accommodation and meals, he added.

He also bared that only the one official representative will get the fixed transportation subsidy.

This year's photo and story exhibit will be on the extractive industries which will be again a competition. 

Each participating paper will be provided a double-sided photo panel. 

As for the regional booth, participants may deck it with products and decors for selling just like the previous years. 

The activity will kick off with the registration on May 24 to be followed by partnership forum and membership meeting in the afternoon.

The following day, the conference will be held in the morning while the program of the 2017 civil journalism community press awards is slated in the evening together with the fellowship dinner.

The last day of the activity is for checking out in the morning of May 26.
