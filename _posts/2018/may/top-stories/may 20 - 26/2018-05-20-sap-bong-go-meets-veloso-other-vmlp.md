SAP Bong Go meets Veloso, other VMLP

Presidential Special Assistant Christopher “Bong” Go sawTagbilaran City Vice Mayor Jose Antonio “Toto”Veloso and other vice mayors’ league national officers at a Palace meeting Wednesday that further hinted of the Senate bid of the closest Duterte aide.

The meeting was arranged by Francis Tolentino,a political adviser of Pres. Rodrigo Duterte, according to Veloso who acted as spokesperson for the Vice Mayors League of the Philippines (VMLP) – National Executive Board (NEB). 

Both Go and Tolentino have been floated for senators under the administration banner in 2019.

As tokens, Go gave the VMLP officers mobile phone units with pictures of him and Tolentino, plus t-shirts with “GO Na Tayo” print. 

Part of the arrangement was for the NEB to hold its meeting at the Malacañang even if the board also had to conduct its quarterly assembly at a hotel on the same day.

Veloso said only the 17 members of the NEBwho are elected national officers of the VMLP attended the Palace conference.

The VMLP-NEB has many other officers but who are appointed, including the regional representatives. 

Go and Tolentino sat in the VMLP-NEB meeting and joined in discussing a number of concerns affecting the league and local legislative governance, among others.
Bohol, specifically Panglaoisland, will host the national convention of the city and municipal vice mayors on June 27-29, this year. 

Veloso, who is the VMLP national treasurer, said among the expected top convention guests will be“from Malacañang,” although he yet refused to specify.

The national president of the league is Vice Mayor Donnabel Joy Mejia of Magsaysay, Davao del Sur.

Veloso once led the VMLP as interim national president when its then national president, Isko Moreno, ran for senator in the 2016 election. 

Moreno, also close to Veloso, was just appointed by Duterte as undersecretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).

From the Palace, the VMLP officiers proceeded to the Diamond Hotel in Manila for their quarterly assembly, which was also attended by Go and Tolentino as well as Police Dir. Gen. Oscar Albayalde.

Duterte not just once mentioned Go in his preference for senator come 2019 election.
Being the special assistant to Duterte, Go supervises the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) while at the same time serving asthe personal aide to the Philippine president.
Appointed political adviser by Duterte, Tolentino is a former chairman of the Metro Manila Development Authority who tried in 2016 for a Senate seat but failed. (VenreboArigo)
