Johnny G. Orioque, editor-publisher of Bohol Balita Daily News (BBDN), a daily Visayan tabloid, won as the punong barangay in Poblacion, Trinidad town last Monday. 

Orioque garnered 1,136 votes over his rival, Vidal Cajes who got 809 votes.

He was once a municipal councilor of Trinidad and was reported to be eyeing the presidency of the Ligangmga Barangay (LnB) in the town.

If he gets the LnB post in Trinidad, Orioquemay even take a shot in the provincial LnB presently occupied by ex-oficio Board Member Romulo Cepedoza of Danao town.

Aside from Orioque, other media personalities who won in the barangay polls last Monday were Willie Maestrado of Station DYRD who won as barangay kagawad in Bool District this city and ErnPahayahay of Station DYRD who also won as barangay kagawad in Bingag, Dauis town.

But there are other members of the local media who did not make it in the barangay elections. 

They are Roger Balamad of Station DYTR who lost in his bid for punong barangay in Sinakayan, Catigbian and Gerry Cajes of Station DYRD who placed no. 8 in the race for barangay kagawad in Dao District this city.
