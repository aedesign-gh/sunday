Last Tuesday dawn, two soldiers of the 47th Infantry Battalion were wounded after a 30-minute gunbattle against 14 members of the New People’s Army in SitioIlaud of Barangay Campagao,Bilar town.

There was no reported casualty, but Corporal Joel Campillanos sustained wounds in the right cheek and PFC KenethVallota was wounded in the middle finger of his left arm. The two were airlifted from the area and already out of danger.

Brig. Gen. Francisco Delfin, deputy commander of the 3rd Infantry Battalion, said the firefight broke out at about 5 a.m. last Tuesday after reports reached the soldiers who were on patrol in the area at the time. 

He confirmed that the group were members of the New People’s Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CCP).

BilarMayor Norman Palacio also confirmed thereport based on the information relayed to him by police authorities. 

The rebel group was reportedly led by a certain Domingo Compoc, an NPA leader who is a native of the neighboring Barangay Dagohoy.

Reports said 30 minutes after the firefight, the rebels who were armed with high-powered firearms withdrew and fled towards the dense part of the mountain. 

Delfin said the rebels are camped around Campagao and his troops were scouring the area to pursue them.

Palacio said he ordered the evacuation of some 50 families from SitioMaslog in Barangay Zamora in Bilar town to safer areas to prevent them from being trapped by the clash, leaving their fiesta preparation for their relatives and visitors.

Palacio said the rebels have been trying to regain their former mass base but Compoc’s former comrades have already surrendered and settled for a peaceful life. 

Barangay residents must have reported the presence of the Compoc’s group which incidentally had been regularly sighted in the area since December last year. 

The military had confirmed to the Provincial Peace and Order Council (PPOC) the presence of the Compoc group, but insisted that Bohol is still an insurgency-free.
Delfin said Bohol has a community that refutes the presence of rebel groups that may attempt to sow terror. 

Police Regional Director, Chief Supt. Robert Quenery, said checkpoints were established right after the reported clash, and established a joint command post with the 47th IB.
Quenery said special units were also deployed to recover evidence from the scene. He assured that preventive measures are underway to prevent spillover into nearby islands. 
“Para ma track kungmeron mag escape na armed men, we are checking who is involved. We will be conducting an investigation,” he said.

Quenery said that electoral board members and security escorts have completed their tasks for the Barangay and SK elections, and have gone down from the mountainous barangays.

Regional Director VeronicoPetalcorinof COMELEC said the clash did not affect the results of the election since they have proclaimed a winner two hours before the incident. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
