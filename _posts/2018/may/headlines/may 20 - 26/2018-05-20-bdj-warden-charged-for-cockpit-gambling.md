The jail warden of Bohol District Jail is facing raps with the Office of the Ombudsman in the Visayas for gambling at the cockpit in Corella town on Sundays.

Jail Supt. Felipe A. Montejo was charged for frequently entering the Corella cockpit and engaged in betting activities.

Michael Vaňo, a resident of Tubigon town, filed the complaint after he took a video of Montejo entering the cockpit.

Vaňo said he was aware of the directives prohibiting government officials from entering any casinos, cockpit arena and among others of similar nature.

The complaint was filed with the Ombudsman last May 4.The Bohol Sunday News immediately dispatched its news team to the Bohol District Jail to get the side of Montejo after it received a copy of the complaint.

However, Montejo was in Manila at that time but the BSN news team got his cellphone number.

However, when Montejo reported back to his office at BDJ last week, he simply told the BSN reporters that a clearance is required with the regional office of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP)before he will allow them to interview him.

This paper even tried to text and call Montejo in his cellular phone but there was no answer and reply whatsoever.
