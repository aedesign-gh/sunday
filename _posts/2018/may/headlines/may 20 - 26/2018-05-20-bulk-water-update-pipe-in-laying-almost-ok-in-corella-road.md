The bulk water supply from Barangay Patrocinio, Cortes all the way to Panglao town passing through Tagbilaran City and Dauis is now completing the laying of 420 and 300 millimeters pipes in Corella road en route to the city.

Richard Lim, president of Richli Corp. asked for the cooperation of the motorists passing by the Corella road as the operation of heavy equipment in laying down the water pipes can obstruct the traffic flow along the area.

The bulk water project intends to supply water to the hotels and resorts in Panglao town.
The next phase of the operation is the installation of a water reservoir in Catarman, Dauis next month.

Elmer Lim, Richli communications officer, told the Bohol Sunday News that he was thankful for the cooperation and support for the local government units of Cortes, Corella including the city government including the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the issuance of permits and clearances required for their operation.
The bulk water project is set to be completed within six months after its investor secured all the permits and clearances for their operation.

Meanwhile, Davao City Mayor Sarah Z. Duterte-Carpio and her family spent their family vacation recently at the Eskaya Resort in Panglao.

The city mayor met with Richard Lim at the resort during their stay here early this month.

It was more of a family vacation as the presidential daughter shied away from the eyes of the local media.

The city mayor was also here last March as the commencement speaker of the University of Bohol,
