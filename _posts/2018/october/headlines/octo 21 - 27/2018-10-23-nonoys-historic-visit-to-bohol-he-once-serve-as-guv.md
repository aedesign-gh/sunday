To the Boholanomillineals, the name Constancio “Nonoy” Torralba may not necessarily ring a bell.

During the presidency of Corazon C. Aquino, she appointed Constancio C. Torralba as one of her Cabinet members with a rank of deputy minister for transportation and communication.

When Atty. Victor de la Serna was removed as OIC governor of Bohol in the later part of 1986, Torralba, executive vice-president of General Milling Corporation (GMC) was named as his replacement.

In February 1987, Torralba ran for governor under the so-called “Cory magic” and won. His vice-governor was the late Erico B. Aumentado who later became a governor too and died as congressman of the second district.

During his term as Bohol governor, Torralba engaged the services of the UP PLANADES, a study and research group which conducted a feasibility study on the Panglao tourism estate.

The administration of the late Pres. Cory Aquino granted Torralba the assistance of P10 million for the feasibility study.

He later formed the Panglao Tourism Management Committee (PTMANCOM) to outline its tourism development including the construction of the airport and a gold club.

The plan was considered by many a too ambitious. But it did not deter Torralba from pursuing his vision for Panglao.

We will just cut short the story. Torralba, now about to mark his 90th birthday next month, receive a visitor at his house in Mabolo, Cebu City just recently. 

It was Gov. Edgar M. Chatto who dropped by at his uncle, ConstancioChattoTorralba, from his recent trip in China.

The governor invited Torralba to see for himself the developments attained by the provincial government after he serve as one of its leaders.

It was then and there that the children of the former governor decided to make a historic visit to Bohol.

It was like a sort of a reunion of Torralba’s staff including his security personnel at the Capitol and at the Governor’s Mansion when he visited here on Sunday morning.
He saw the present status of the Panglao airport and marvelled at its buildings, th control tower and the runway. 

It was a dream come true for Torralba and his vision for Bohol.
