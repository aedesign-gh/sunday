PANGLAO.-The Court of Appeals (CA) finally resolved last week the mayoralty standoff here and ordered Leonila Montero reinstated as the legitimate mayor of Bohol’s premier tourist town.

In its resolution promulgated Oct. 16, , CA said “it appearing that the petitioner has already served the administratively penalty of three months suspension without pay, she is hereby ordered reinstated forthwith.”

The CA also denied the motion for reconsideration of respondent Agustin M. Cloribel in a case filed by Montero docketed CA-G.R. SP No. 154605.

The said resolution was signed by Associate Justice Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. and concurred by Associate Justices Pablito A. Perez and Rafael Antonio M. Santos.

Earlier, Vice-Mayor Pedro Fuertes, who acted as the mayor for several months while Montero served her penalty, vowed to vacate the post only if there’s court order for the latter to prove.

After she served the three-month suspension, Montero invoked section 46 of the Local Government Code of 1991 and tried to resume as mayor but Fuertes refused since there was no court order.

alemate between the two protagonists Montero and Fuertes ensued, making the town having two mayors. It caused confusion among the workers.

The refusal of Fuertes to step down as mayor has prompted Montero to file before the CA the Urgent Motion for Clarification in CA-G.R. SP No. 154605.

The CA then treated the said case along with the denial of Agustin’s Motion for Reconsideration on June 28, 2018 decision of the CA.

The said decision refers to CA’s setting aside Montero’s dismissal but upheld her suspension for three months imposed by the Ombudsman.

“The respondent Agustin, as a person who initiated the investigation with the Office of the Ombudsman, has no direct, legal personality to impugn our decision and move for its reconsideration. He is not the party adversely affected by our decision.”
The Court also pointed out, even when the  respondent’s motion for reconsideration is in order, the grounds offered “are mere rehash of his earlier arguments” which the court considered as “insufficient to prove the element of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule to qualify the petitioner’s misconduct as grave.”

“Considering that no appeal or motion for reconsideration has been interposed by the Office of the Ombudsman within the reglementary period, our decision dated 28 June 2018 has already attained finality and its execution is immediate by operation of the law.”
 
“Accordingly, the court orders the reinstatement of the petitioner for her former position as Municipal Mayor of Panglao, Bohol,” the CA decision said.

It will be recalled that legal battle between Montero and Cloribel stemmed from the former’s act of appointing defeated candidates of her slate in 2013. Said act is a violation of one year ban for defeated bets, except for defeated barangay bets pursuant to the said Code.

Cloribel reportedly filed a complaint and asked the Ombudsman to conduct investigation over the appointment of the defeated candidates by Montero. rvo
