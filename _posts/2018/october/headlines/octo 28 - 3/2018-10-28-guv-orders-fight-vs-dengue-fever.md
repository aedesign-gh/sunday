Gov. Edgar M. Chatto ordered all the mayors and barangay captains last week to conduct intensified and sustained activities against dengue, which has already caused over 700 deaths nationwide.

The Department of Health (DOH) reported that dengue cases soared to more than 138,000, with Luzon areas and Western Visayas having the highest, including the deaths in past nine months.

The governor on Friday issued a memorandum circular whichalso called the attention of all city and municipal health officers, and DepEd superintendents and PTA officers under both the DepEd Bohol and Tagbilaran City Divisions.

As in many other parts of the country, dengue, a fatal infectious disease, is again resurging in Bohol, threatening lives and compromising the health of communities.

Prevention is a must by identifying and destroying mosquito breeding sites but, the governor said, every household must be the first destroyer of the dengue cause through sanitation.

Chatto said this can be effectively done with the active and sustained participation of the community, starting with every household.

The governor directed the mayors and barangay chairmen, assisted by their respective health units, to organize anti-dengue campaign committees, which are tasked to:

•	Advocate an active and sustained anti-dengue drive through the “4S” strategy;

•	Direct simultaneous search-and-destroy and clean-ups targeting mosquito breeding sites in all barangays; and

•	Provide technical and logistical support to the Aksyon Barangay Kontra Dengue (ABKD).

The 4S strategy involves: 1) Search and destroy mosquito breeding places 2) Secure self-protection 3) Seek early consultation (if with symptoms), and 4) Support fogging/spraying in dengue hotspot areas.

The provincial government, through the Provincial Health Office, has consistently been advocating to the LGUs the "4S" strategy against dengue.

The governor also ordered the formation of functional ABKD Task Forces in all barangays which will: 

•	Advocate and implement active and sustained anti-dengue activities through massive and house-to-house information dissemination;

•	Develop an effective dengue control plan and put the same into effect on a sustained basis using the 4S strategy promoted by the DOH; 

•	Spearhead weekly barangay clean-upand search-and-destroy operations directed at mosquito breeding sites; and

•	Organize Purok Dengue Brigades to ensure grassroot anti-dengue drive.

The city and municipal health officers will ensure the effective monitoring of dengue cases and facilitate early medical intervention to dengue suspects.

The will be assisted by their network of support---public health nurses, rural health midwives, sanitary inspectors, NDPs and BHWs.

The local chief executives will coordinate with the DepEd authorities and PTA officers to compliment the anti-dengue effort in schools.

Chatto said every LGU will allocate modest support fund for the operation of the anti-dengue program.

NATIONAL CASES VS BOHOL CASES

While the DOH recorded more than138,000 dengue cases nationwide, only over 1,200 cases, including 15 deaths, have been reported in Bohol this year.

There were more dengue cases reported in Bohol in 2015 and 2016.

Across the country, the DOH Dengue Surveillance showed a 21% increase in the number of potentially deadly infection recorded in various government hospitals in past nine months compared to the same period last year.

The Philippine Star reported that from Jan. 1 to Oct. 6, the DOH recorded 138,444 dengue cases, up from 114,878 cases during the same period in 2017.

The DOH said the number of deaths due to dengue also rose from 581 in 2017 to 708 this year. 

Central Luzon posted the biggest number of cases with 22,077, followed by the National Capital Region (NCR) with 18,831, and Calabarzon with 16,177. 

Other regions with high cases of dengue include Ilocos Region with 11,109 and Western Visayas, 11,036.

While Central Luzon had the most number of cases, NCR recorded the highest number of deaths with 106, followed by Calabarzon, 98, and Western Visayas, 69. Central Luzon recorded 61 deaths and Northern Mindanao, 53. 

A high 22% or 29,874 of the total cases belong to the 10 to 14 years age group. 
More than half or 73,017 of the cases were males while females accounted for 65,427 or 47% of the dengue cases nationwide

ATTITUDE, FIRST RESPONSIBILITY

At times, when people become complacent in 4S, mosquito vector once again thrives and causes rise in illnesses in susceptible communities.

Dengue is like illegal drug and, thus, it is, first and foremost, every family's lookout.

The governor is serious against dengue because, unknown to many, he had lost a young sister to the dreaded disease long time ago. It was probably the first dengue death in Bohol.

Chattosaid every household should realize that it is the "first level of government" to take direct action, although community involvement also remains a must.
Primary healthcare applies as preventive mode before curative medicine comes in. (VenreboArigo)
