Last week, Pres. Duterte in Cabalogan, Samar, told the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) stationed there to kill without hesitation of those who are identified as members of the New People’s Army.

What he did not tell to the army was how to get away with nightmares.

Sometime early this year, I was in invited to a fiesta of a town near Tagbilaran.  At the house where I was invited I was introduced to the new chief of police of my town who was already inebriated when we shook hands. We exchanged pleasantries until our conversation reached extrajudicial killing.

“I do not believe in government sponsored extrajudicial killings,” I told the chief of police, “Because those who are involved with drugs are getting at each other’s throat.”

“Sometimes there are,” he said. “ I had already killed a number of criminals,” he boasted.

“When you shot a person point blank, do not look at his eyes,” he said. “You will get nightmares when you look at his eyes. Turn away at once.” He said. Then he added : That is what I taught to my subordinates.”

The chief of police said nightmares, remorse, guilt and paranoia are the usual consequences of having snuff out a life.Nightmares, the consequence and aftermath of killing a person is the most terrifying of all, the chief of police said.

When Pres. Duterte came here last June during the nationwide convention of vice mayors, he was proud to tell the crowd that one of his college professors in Manila was a Boholano named Atty. Victor de la Serna whowas a former OIC governor.

“He taught me Criminal Law. Kaya naging criminal ako.”

Laughter. 

Many people did not believe Duterte is a killer. If he had killed somebody, God will not allow him to become the president of the Philippines and he would tell the AFP how not to get nightmares. 

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:  Everyone has his own time.
