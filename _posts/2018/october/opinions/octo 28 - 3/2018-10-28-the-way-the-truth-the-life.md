The way, the truth, the life
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

I am writing in the first person point of view today because this is something really personal to me. I am deeply disturbed by events that are happening in the world.

I grew up believing that the United States of America protects the rest of the world from Communist Russia. Today, we are seeing the President of the United States of America acting like a puppet of Russia. 

After watching Donald Trump praise Vladimir Putin on worldwide television, Richard Alan Clarke, former National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism for the United States, said this: “In the intelligence community, we have a term for Trump’s behavior. Someone behaving that way is considered a “controlled asset””.

Imagine that. The President of the United States of America acting like a controlled asset of its enemy, Russia?! Something is going on in the world today. And this is not nice.

I grew up believing that the Philippines is a staunch ally of the United States of America and the latter protects other countries, particularly its friend and ally the Philippines, from Communist Russia and China. But who does the President of the Philippines consider his idols and allies today? Xi Jin Ping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia. Both, of course, are communists.

I grew up believing that the Roman Catholic Church stands up to dictators in the world. The Berlin wall which used to divide East and West Germany has fallen and ended the hegemony of the Soviet Union because of Mikhail Gorbachev whose mother was Roman Catholic. The EDSA Revolution happened because Jaime Cardinal Sin, who was then the titular head of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines, called on the Filipino people to protect the rebel soldiers led by then General Fidel V. Ramos.

Recently, however, a number of Roman Catholic priests were killed, an old Australian nun who has been helping poor farmers for decades is being expelled, and the President called its god stupid. But what was the response of the present leaders of that church? “Rejoice and be glad”.

This seems to me a depiction of Revelation 12: 9, “The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him”.

In this passage of the Bible, Satan, the devil is here on earth because he was hurled down here by Michael, the Archangel, who defeated him in their fight in heaven. Satan leads the world astray and his angels are with him.

We must strengthen ourselves in prayer and trust in our Lord Jesus Christ’s promise: Ego Sum Via, Veritas et Vita! These are truly difficult and testing times, and without faith, hope and love, we will surely be led astray.
