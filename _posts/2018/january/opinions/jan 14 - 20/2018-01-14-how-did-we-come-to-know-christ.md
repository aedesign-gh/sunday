2nd Sunday of Ordinary Time (cycle B)
Readings:	1 Sam 3:3-10, 19; 1 Cor6:13-15; 17-20; Jn1:35-42

When I was still a little boy, my mother used to tell me Bible stories before going to sleep.  One of my favorite characters in the Bible is Jesus Christ.  I really admired his being a selfless person.  He is very compassionate and forgiving.  He helped a lot of people.  I so admired Jesus that I even said to myself that I want to become like him.

My mother had a younger brother who is a priest.  Every time my uncle visited our home, I could see in him the person of Jesus Christ.  For me that time the person whom I could closely associate with Christ is the priest.  And so with my childhood simple logic, I said that if I wanted to become like Jesus Christ who is my favorite Bible character, I should become a priest then.

My mother did not only introduce Jesus into my life, she also planted the seed of the vocation to the priesthood to me with her Bible stories.  One time I was invited to give an input on who is Jesus Christ, I was so happy because it brought back beautiful memories on how I came to know Him.

So let us try to recall that moment on how we came to know Jesus Christ.  Some of us can perhaps relate with my story.  Some might have come to know Jesus through their families, friends, associates, the community, the Bible, the Gospel, the homily, media, etc.  But we cannot also deny the reality that for most people, their knowledge of Jesus Christ is more trivial rather than relational.  Some only ended up more with head knowledge rather thanheart knowledge.

In the first reading we are told that God tries to meet people, calls them by name, and makes his voice heard.  The Gospel describes the meeting that every person is invited to have with Christ.  Christ has the words of eternal life, and many can meet him only is somebody tells them about him.  The second reading tells us of the happy consequences of meeting Christ: a completely new life, a radical change in our way of thinking and acting.

The Catechism For Filipino Catholics says that to really know Jesus Christ is a life-long task.  To know him is a living, changing, growing, and deepening experience.  It is not like knowing some fact of information.  Rather, knowing Jesus means entering into a personal relationship with him.  The Jesus we come to know is both the historical earthly Jesus and the Risen Christ of faith.  To know Jesus means being committed to following him, being his disciple.  There is no authentic “knowing of Jesus Christ” outside of personal commitment to his teaching and way of life.  Knowing Jesus must make a difference in our lives.  And we come to know who Jesus is from what he did, his salvific mission.

In the Gospel, we heard Jesus was given by John the Baptist the title “Lamb of God”.  The first two disciples address him simply as “rabbi” which means “master”, “teacher”.  Andrew, after passing the whole night talking with him, understands that he is not just a great man but “the Messiah” himself.  A few verses later, Philip will speak of Jesus as the one “of whom Moses in the Law and the prophets wrote”.  Nathanael will address him as: “the son of God, the king of Israel.  Jesus calls himself simply “son of man”.

Who is Jesus for us?  What do we understand him to be, not after just one night but after so many years of discipleship?
