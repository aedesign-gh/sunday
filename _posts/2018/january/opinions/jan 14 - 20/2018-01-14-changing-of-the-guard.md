Col. Ignacio Madriaga assumed as the new Commanding Officer of the 302nd Brigade of the AFP based in Katipunan, Carmen last Thursday.  Col. Madriaga took over from BGen. Arnulfo Matanguihan who was promoted as Assistant Division Commander of the 9th Infantry Division, AFP with headquarters in the Bicol Region.  

Bgen. Matanguihan earned his first star in Bohol as 302nd Brigade Commander for two years.  He is well remembered for his successful thwarting and neutralization of the Abu Sayyaf Group that tried to establish a foothold in Bohol in April last year and for keeping and maintaining the insurgency-free status of Bohol until he relinquished his post to Col. Madriaga. The 302ndBrigades’s area of responsibility (AOR) includes the provinces of Cebu and Siquijor.

As he starts his assignment at the 302nd Brigade, Col. Madriaga is faced with the bigger challenge of keeping and maintaining Bohol an insurgency-free province because the CPP-NPA has vowed to re-establish at least two guerrilla fronts in Bohol before the mid-term elections (if there will be one) in 2019.Col. Madriaga’s efforts though will find support in the AFP’s plan announced lately to cut the number of the NPAs by half this year 2018,although the CPP-NPA was quick to label the announcement as “delusional” saying Pres. Duterte is becoming the "best recruiter" for the NPA and called the AFP as "best supplier of arms for the armed revolution."

The CPP-NPA warned that the communist rebels will strive to seize more weapons by launching more tactical offensives.

Gen. Rey Guerrero, AFP Chief of Staff, estimated the NPA force to be around 3,700 during the military and defense department's annual New Year callon him.

This renewed campaign of the military against the local communist rebels came after Pres. Rodrigo Duterte halted all peace talks with the CPP-NPA and declared them as terrorists as a result of their ambushes and armed attacks on military personnel.

There may be pressure on Col. Madriaga to maintain and even surpass the achievement of Bgen. Matanguihan, but with the promised full cooperation of all the government agencies, especially the local government units led by the provincial government of Bohlol, the commitments of Col. Madriaga can be easily attained.

On the part of the people of Bohol, it will not be difficult to provide their support and cooperation through giving of information to the military just like what they did when the Abu Sayyaf came because now they have both experiences to compare – experience with life when they had the CPP-NPAs in their communities and experience with life without the CPP-NPAs after Bohol was declared insurgency-free in 2010 and continued to be so until at present.

Insurgency will only thrive when people feel neglected, uncared for and unattended by their government.  People may be poor and deprived of so many things but if they see that their government is sincere and committed in doing its best to improve their lives by improving their access to health and educational services and facilities, to better market for their products, to additional livelihood and better infrastructures, they will abhor armed or violent solution to their problems as is the advocacy of the local communists.

Peace is always the best option and strategy in the pursuit of a happy temporal life in this world.(For comments, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
