BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

I did not invent these ideas. I just stumbled upon them from a site in the Internet called Spirit Science. And for the simple reason that I found them amazing, let me share them with you with a little explanation as to how I understand their meaning.

First Idea:  Every creature, every person, everywhere and anywhere, makes the very ‘best’ action, makes the very best choice considering all the information they perceive.

I think this is the reason why our Lord Jesus Christ taught us that we must forgive. We must forgive because every one of us who does any action is simply doing what he or she is doing to the extent of his or her understanding and appreciation of the situation at such time. In other words, that is one’s best effort under the circumstances. That is the reason why he said, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do”.

Second Idea:  Every creature, every person, every single thing, everywhere and anywhere, is intimately connected to one another, as if it is, one grand organism.

There are many versions of this idea nowadays. In fact, modern environmental science has enough proof to show that even the smallest flap of a butterfly in one corner of the world has an effect to the whole planet. One tree cut in the Philippines, or one plastic wrapper thrown to the sea has an effect to the entire ecosystem. How much more if you kill even one person? But, of course, the opposite is equally true. If you do a one single good action, it benefits us all.

Third Idea:  The very ‘best’ action, the very ‘best’ choice, is the one that considers the welfare of every creature, every person, every single thing, everywhere and anywhere to the benefit of one another, as if it we are in fact, one grand organism.

The second and third ideas are, in fact, the reasons why I do believe that the true meaning of the Golden Rule (Do unto others what you want others to do unto you) is this: What you do to others, you are actually doing to yourself. The logic being, that since we are just parts of one organism, we are indeed one. Thus, if you hurt another, you are actually hurting yourself. Conversely, if you are loving and serving another, you are actually doing it to yourself.

These ideas are simply shared here for whatever blessing they may bring to anyone. There is no compulsion to believe them. May you be blessed.
