As we re-joined the BoholTri-Media Association (BTMA) as its legal counsel and member of the board, we see a lot of concerns in the media group which needs reforms.

When we drafted the constitution and by-laws of the association a couple of decades ago, there are a lot of changes that transpired in the interregnum.

First, the media workers were classified into technical and actual media practitioners. 

It did not include the media associations in the government like the Effective Development Communications Unit (EDCOM) of the provincial government and the Association of United Development Information Officers(AUDIO) of national government agencies.

During the induction of BTMA officers last Friday night, Bishop Abet Uy of the Diocese of Tagbilaran who was our inducting officer, mentioned about the fake news particularly on the social media.

When we drafted the BTMA constitution and by-laws, Channel 6 of the Bohol Community Cable TV had its own programming, so we called the association as tri-media representing the radio stations, local newspapers and the cable television here.

There was no Facebook, Twitter and blogs for the social media. 

Now, even the Philippine Communications Operations Office (PCOO) under the Office of the President has an undersecretary in the person of Mocha Uson for the social media.

So we will proposed that it will no longer be a tri-media but a quadruple media association including the social media and the bloggers.

Rightfully, it now belongs to the so-called Fourth Estate although originally, the meaning of the description befits of independence from the three branches of government under a presidential form.
Now that we are going into Federalism, it is but proper for the BTMA to become a quadruple media group.

The BTMA officers are elected by voting for the members of the board of directors who in turn will elect the officers. The board of directors are elected without filing a certificate of candidacy from all the members of the association present during the general assembly.

We will propose that a certificate of candidacy must be a condition sine quanon before a BTMA member can voted as a member of the board of directors.

The same is true for the election of officers who are also elected through a single ballot from among the members of the board. The same shall be voted for every position from the president down to the treasurer.

It is our humble opinion that the present set-up of election the BTMA officers practically denied the democratic process.

Finally, our proposal will for the association to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a non-stock, non-profit organization so that it can validly secure a receipt from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).

Anyway, we do hope that our re-elected president, Engr. Tiburcio “Tibbs” Bullecer Jr. will immediately buckle down to work and prepare for a planning workshop of the association in the next few days after our induction last Friday at the Bohol Tropics Resort.
