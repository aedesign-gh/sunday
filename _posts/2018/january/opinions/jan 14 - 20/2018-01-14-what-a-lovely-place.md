Last week we motored to Danao town to see the place for the first time since this town seemed figuratively at the last frontier of Bohol. Its distance from the city which is at the heartland of Bohol made you feel going there as if you are heading at a place of no return. When I was young, there was no other way to get to Danao but from Carmen town only. Folks related that to get there was scary because most of the road was on the top of the ridge which they called “buko-bukosakabaw” because both sides sloop down to the deep valleys below. 

A new shorter route to Danao is from Sagbayantown which is 21 kilometers. Stories I heard before was that this route was a dusty rough road, but we were fortunate enough that when we were there, the road was wide, concrete and no dust. What came to my mind was the late Gov. EricoAumentadoas one of his main pet projects was concreting major roads of the province, and finding and opening new and shorter routes  between towns. In fact his project of cementing the lonely road fromBatuan town to Hanopol, Balilihanis now almost a reality as it is now on its finishing touches. 

As we proceed to Danao, every turns on a bend opens up breathtaking sceneriesof high hills as if reaching to the skies. At the crest ofhills give you heart-stopping panorama of distant blue mountains.  The undulating scenery was awesome to behold.Danao town is almost a virginal place.  

Untouched scenery is the rewards of explorers. And this made me ponder about the first explorers of the North Pole. Their loneliness and physical weariness were rewarded with the magnificent beauty of the Aurora Borealis as this could not be seen elsewhere except also at the South Pole. This phenomenon baffles scientists and defies explanation for years.

A few meters from the highway was a newly opened garden of 30,000-plastic magical red anturioms. (This is their spelling on their billboard along the way.) We negotiated a narrowbarangay and deeply rutted dirt road as there were “habal-habal” we met before we reached a high plain. Before we reached the magical garden we were flagged down by two men manning an out post and were told to buy tickets at P30 each. Having bought the tickets the bamboo bar across the road was lifted.

We reached the garden. It could not be seen from the outside as there were big advertisement tarpaulin of commercial establishments, perhaps sister companies of the garden.

The flat grassland across the garden served as the parking area. The “chichiria” vendors as there were already three stalls there, told us that on early mornings one can also see the sea of clouds below. At night the iris-descent light of Cebu could be seen. We told the vendors to sell puto, bingka or bananas with sikwati as they will be a good and additional come on to the garden.

We will just wait and see if the all red magical plastic antoriums will fly high like the one in Bagumbayan, Pilar. Its unprecedented popularity was made possible by the uploads of visitors who had visited the place. The social media saved its owners from the astronomical costs of advertisement.
