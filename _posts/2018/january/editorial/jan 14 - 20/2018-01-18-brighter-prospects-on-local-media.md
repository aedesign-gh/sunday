In the past, we have been propagating on how divided is the local media when it comes to local governance.

There seems to be a demarcation line between those who are identified with the administration and the opposition.

Well, we have to understand that each media practitioner has his or her own agenda whether in the field of print or broadcast. Some are even classified as paid hacks.

Bishop Abet Uy of the Diocese of Tagbilaran, who presided over the oath-taking ceremonies of the newly-elected officers of Bohol Tri-Media Association (BTMA) last Friday, has unloaded a very strong message to the local media practitioners.

“Know the purpose of your work”, the Tagbilaran prelate emphasized. “Is it for livelihood or for something else”, he asked.

He challenged the Bohol mediamen to know the purpose of their work as purveyors of truth. Be evangelizers of the truth, he added.

Then Bishop Uy narrated a story about a boy who kept on asking people on what they are doing. Many abhorred his queries and got mad at him.

But a group of construction workers preparing cement works answered the young boy that they are building posts for a cathedral.

The message of the story, according to Bishop Uy, is to know the purpose of the work of mediamen, whether they are working in the private sector or even in the government.

As purveyors of truth, the local media is expected to tell the truth and not to help juggle the minds of the public and advance the interests of their hidden bosses both in the government and in the private sector.

It is therefore incumbent on the members of the local media to lay their cards in public, including the readers and listeners, so that the people will have an idea on what agenda they are trying to profess.

With this, we can have a better prospects on how the local media perform their tasks of being purveyors, nay, evangelizers, of truth.
