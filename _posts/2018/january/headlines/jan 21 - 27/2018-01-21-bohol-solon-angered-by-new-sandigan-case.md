Rep. Arthur C. Yap (3rd District, Bohol) last week said he was angry with the filing of a new graft charges against him with the Sandiganbayan as it was meant for political harassment.

Yap is facing additional graft charges after the Office of the Ombudsman filed two more criminal cases at the Sandiganbayan for P15.78 million in car loans of employees of the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) during his term as agriculture secretary.

In a radio interview over Station DYRD, the solon said the case was filed in 2009 yet but he was surprised why it was just filed now. In fact, his name was not included in the documents covering the entire transaction as he was merely a member of the board, Yap said.

Also included in the charges were then PhilRice Board of Trustees members JohniferBatara, Fe Laysa, William Padolina, Winston Corvera, Gelia Castillo, SenenBacani, Rodolfo Undan and Executive Director RoniloBeronio.

The officials were accused of violating Sec. 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for allegedly giving unwarranted benefits to PhilRice employee-beneficiaries, as well as Sec. 3(g) for supposedly entering into grossly disadvantageous contracts or transactions on behalf of the government from 2008 to 2009.

Yap is also currently facing two sets of graft cases at the Sandiganbayan in connection with the alleged misuse of Priority Development Assistance Funds of former lawmakers Rodolfo Antonino and Marina Clarete. He is presently out on bail with these cases.

Based on the information filed by the Ombudsman, PhilRice officials including Yap, who was then chairman of the Board of Trustees, instituted car plans that allowed employees to “obtain personal loans from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) for the purchase of their private cars, secured by the PhilRice funds through hold-out agreements with PNB.”

The cars, classified as private in nature, were then “leased by PhilRice for the official use of the beneficiary-employee without the benefit of public bidding, with the beneficiary-employee still entitled to transportation allowance despite the use of an official vehicle.”
