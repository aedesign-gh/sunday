Through the initiative of Powerhouse Training and Review Center (PTRC) here, the biggest number of passers of the recent teachers’ examination took their oath before the Professional Regulations Commission (PRC) at the Holy Name University (HNU) gym last Thursday afternoon. 

OIC Regional Director Gina Emperado of PRC 7 assisted by RaymundEnglis administered the oath-taking of more than 600 new teachers.

Deans of the education departments of local schools and universities also attended the oath-taking rites last week.

Cristine I. Sajonia, Powerhouse executive assistant for operations, led the staff in facilitating the oath-taking rites, considered by many as one of the biggest gathering of passers of the Basic Licensure Examination for Professional Teachers (BLEPT).

The oath-taking rites started at exactly 3 o’clock in the afternoon last Thursday highlighted by the message of Emperado.

The honouring of the new Licensed Professional Teachers (LPT) followed with the messages of the deans of the education department of local schools and universities here.

Atty. Arlene P. Palgan, Powerhouse president and chief review director, who is presently in the United States, sent Atty. Danilo A. Bantugan as her representative who delivered the closing remarks.

Palgan is working out for the hiring of teachers in the US.

Just recently, Powerhouse has been awarded as the Center for Excellence for Trainings and Reviews in the country for 2017.

The award came four years after Powerhouse was awarded as No. 1 and most quality training and review center in the Philippines in 2012 and 2015.
