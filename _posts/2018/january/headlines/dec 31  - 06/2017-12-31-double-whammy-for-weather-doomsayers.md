It may appear to be a double-whammy for the weather doomsayers who posted screaming news in both the local newspapers and social media last week regarding two brewing typhoons which would have destroyed Christmas Day and the New Year celebrations here.

First they threatened local residents on the impact of Tropical Storm (TS) Vinta which may hit the province on the eve of Christmas Day.

The nativity of Christ was celebrated by Boholanos without any threat to their livers save for the light rains as Vinta passed by Bohol on Dec. 24.

Not contented with their threats, dubious weather forecasters again spotted a weather disturbance down Mindanao and called it Wilma which never came.

But again, a low pressure area projected to develop into a storm was again spotted crossing into the Philippine Area of Responsibility east of Mindanao at the New Year’s Day.

A low pressure area (LPA) which entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) tomorrow is forecast to develop into a tropical depression with its movement going across the Visayas starting tomorrow.

Radio broadcast were very noisy when the vessels bound for Dumaguete City suspended their trips due to strong waves.

The weather disturbance was be called “Agaton”and developed into the first storm which will traverse the PAR in 2018.

But in the northern part of the province, there were no indications that a weather disturbance is coming.

An evening at the Anda de Boracay, the Bohol Sunday News showed the moon and the stars hovering this particular point of the planet, dispelling any weather disturbance even as the local weather bureau projected Agaton to follow the path of TS Vinta which entered Northern Mindanao and travelled towards the Zamboanga Peninsula.

It is expected to landfall either late tomorrow morning.

The disaster risk reduction and management councils and local government units in Zamboanga Peninsula and Muslim Mindanao regions are bracing for Agaton while most of its areas are still reeling from the devastation of Vinta (international name: Tembin).

While closely monitoring the prevailing low-pressure area east of Mindanao, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) issued a gale warning advisory over seaboards of northern, eastern and central Luzon.

The gale warning that also covered eastern and southern seaboards of Southern Luzon and the eastern and western seaboards of the Visayas automatically makes sea travel of small water craft risky if not highly dangerous.

The coastal waters of Bohol facing Mindanao failed to indicate any strong winds and waves last Saturday morning as the sea was very calm.
