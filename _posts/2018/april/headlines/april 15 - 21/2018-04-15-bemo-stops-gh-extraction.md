GARCIA-HERNANDEZ.- Sand and gravel extraction from mineral-rich Manaba river of this limestone-rich town refuses to die down always generating controversy in what may be described as sand and quarrel.

It is said that sand and gravel are the main commodities used for infrastructure and massive human activities seemed never-ending following the earthquake in 2013. They are used for roads, dams, buildings, airport, land reclamations.
The manual extraction is going on when this writer visited the place recently.

One of the gatherers said he doesn’t know what they are doing is legal or not.

Alarmed by this scenario, the Bohol Environment Management Office (BEMO) of the provincial government has acted after learning that alleged illegal sand and gravel extraction is still going on without let up, Tata Ganub, officer-in-charge said.

“Didto si Engr. Galicinao sa Garcia-Hernandez last April 5 sa area with PO1 Cadiz and Mun. Admin. Salise daghan kayo daw mga sinako Naggama sa Anna sa iyang report and drafted stoppage order addressed to the mayor ug barangay captain sa Manaba, Sacaon,ug Tabuan. Asked pa ko kon na deliver na ba ang ma stoppage order kay wa paman ko nakauli gud,” Ganub said.
“It has been going on a long time ago,” she said in vernacular.

She said that a cooperative has been organized but was stalled since nobody takes charge as point person in complying the requirements.

BEMO is coordinating with the Mines and geo-Sciences Bureau of the DENR to assist the sand gatherers to make the activities (hauling gathering) legal.

But former BMEO chief Loloy Lafuente inquired in his fb post.

“Unsa diay initiatives sa lgus municipal ug brgy..when they are mandated to safeguard their respective local environment.”

“Sa aku pay nagdala sa enforcement sa mineral i always appear to brgy general assembly apil mga brgy sessions para sa hugot nga campanya..unya dakup sa mga hauler,” he said.

“Problema lng diha kay daghang negosyante nga naa pod sa poder sa pangagamhanan.” (The problem of the LGU (referring this town) is that there are a lot of businessmen, who are with the seat of government here, dealing with minerals.)
“Kinsa may mamadlong nga ang mga mamadlongay nagpabadlong man sad,” he added. (rvo)
