Ex-City Prosecutor Adriano “Dodo” Montes joined his creator last Friday at the age of 70.

His bereaved wife, Atty. Nuevas T. Montes, said the late city prosecutor died while asleep at their residence near Cainget Beach here at around 2 o’clock early dawn last April 13.

He died on the day that the retirement of his wife as president of the University of Bohol took effect.

Montes, a native of Cabilao, Loon, is an avid reader of this paper as a subscriber.

Montes rose from the ranks in the Department of Justice as a fiscal then to an assistant prosecutor before retiring as a city prosecutor at the age of 65.

He was well-loved in the legal circle here being a good natured person.

During his retirement, he was widely known as a presidential husband, being the hubby of the UB president.

He joined the retirement gatherings of his wife from the academe in his final days.

His children and grandchildren both here and abroad are expected to arrive here momentarily.

His internment will be announced later.
