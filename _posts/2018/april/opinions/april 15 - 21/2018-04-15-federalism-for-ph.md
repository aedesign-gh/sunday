Federalism was already a campaign promise that Pres. Rodrigo R. Duterte had when he was running for Presidency.  That Filipinos gave him an overwhelming vote to lead the country in the next six years would indicate that majority of them agreed  it is time the country take the shift to that form of government.  But what is federalism and do we all understand what we are getting into?

Yesterday the MRRD (Mayor Rodrigo R. Duterte) movement, a prime mover of federalism, finally made a big public move to make itself known in Bohol by inviting all who count in the province to join its movement.  Participants from across partisan political parties (Liberal Party, PDP-Laban, NPC, etc.) were invited to ensure that this is not a partisan affair but a movement that espouses federalism. (Although I know for a fact that many of those they tried to convince to join have already been promised political and civil positions in government.)  How this movement will develop in the future is not yet certain because there are now two groups claiming to have the authority to organize in Bohol. 

Anyway since not all our readers have access to libraries and the internet to know more about federalism besides those they hear from the proponents during forums, let me share width you what Rappler , yes the Rappler whose staff was banned from Malacanang activities, has come up with in trying to help people to know the pros and cons of federalism. This will in a way prepare us with an informed vote or decision just in case the shift to federalism will be put to a plebiscite by Congress, through the Comelec, in the future.

So what is Federalism? It is a form of government where sovereignty is constitutionally shared between a central governing authority and constituent political units called states or regions.

In basic terms, it will break the country into autonomous regions with a national government focused only on interests with nationwide bearing: foreign policy and defense, for example.

The autonomous regions or states, divided further into local government units, will have primary responsibility over developing their industries, public safety, education, healthcare, transportation, recreation, and culture. These states will have more power over their finances, development plans, and laws exclusive to their jurisdiction. The central government and states can also share certain powers.

How is this different from what we have now where we have the administrative regions and local government units have also been granted vast autonomy by the Local Government Code of 1991 or R.A. 7160??

We presently have a unitary form of government. Most administrative powers and resources are with the national government based in Metro Manila. Its Malacañang that decides how much to give local government units. The process is prone to abuse, with governors and mayors sometimes having to beg Malacañang for projects they believe their communities need. How local government units spend their budget has to be approved by the national government.

In federalism, the states will have the power to make these decisions with little or no interference from the national government. Examples of federal countries are the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, India, Malaysia.
PROS of Federalism.

Locals decide for themselves. Regions have their own unique problems, situations, geographic, cultural, social and economic contexts. Federalism allows them to create solutions to their own problems instead of distant Metro Manila deciding for them.

The states can establish policies that may not be adopted nationwide. For example, liberal Metro Manila can allow same-sex marriage which the state of Bangsamoro, predominantly Muslim, would not allow. In the United States, some states like Colorado and Washington have legalized recreational marijuana even if other states have not.

This makes sense in an archipelago of over 7,000 islands and 28 dominant ethnic groups. For decades, the national government has been struggling to address the concerns of 79 (now 81) provinces despite challenges posed by geography and cultural differences.

With national government, and thus power, centered in Metro Manila, its no surprise that development in the mega city has spiralled out of control while other parts of the country are neglected.

More power over funds, resources. Right now, local government units can only collect real estate tax and business permit fees. In federalism, they can retain more of their income and are required to turn over only a portion to the state government they fall under.

Thus, local governments and state governments can channel their own funds toward their own development instead of the bulk of the money going to the national government. They can spend the money on programs and policies they see fit without waiting for the national governments go signal.

Promotes specialization. The national and state governments can specialize in different policy domains. With most administrative powers now with the regional governments, the national government can focus on foreign policy, defense, and other nationwide concerns, like healthcare and taxation.

States have more autonomy to focus on economic development using their core competencies and industries. The state of Central Luzon can focus on becoming an agricultural hub. The state of Mimaropa, home to Palawan, can choose to use eco-tourism as its primary launch pad.

Possible solution to the Mindanao conflict. The creation of the state of Bangsamoro within a federalist system may address concerns of separatists who crave more autonomy over the administration of Muslim Mindanao.(To be continued)
