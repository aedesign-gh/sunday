Despite some lapses, technical or financial, we humbly submit that reaching the third anniversary of this paper on Tuesday is indeed quite a feat.
s
Although there are still a lot of rooms for improvement in publishing and editing this paper, but our existence for the last three years is doubtlessly awesome.

Although our critics, personal or otherwise, refused to accept the fact that we have finally become an editor-publisher of a local community newspaper.

But at the end of the day, they cannot delete the fact that we practically rose from the rank of a mere news hunter, to a reporter, to an anchorman, commentator and columnist for more than two decades.

Others cannot accept these achievements and tried to harass and destroy our ways. That is plain and simply crab mentality.

The dean of community newspapering, the late Atty. Zoilo Dejaresco started the Bohol Chronicle empty handed.
Being his fan, we tried to follow his ways although we find it hard to imitate his traits and character as an editor-publisher.

Are we dreaming to have our own printing press and operate a radio station? Why not. No one is prohibited to dream. “Walang masama sa mangarap”. Or “hanggang pangarap na lang?”

As what others say, do not wish for things as it may come true.

Of course, we do not rest upon our laurels having attained the third anniversary of this paper.

There are still more things to come and even beyond our expectations and dreams. We just stay to be positive and adopt to revolutionary changes in our midst.

In our third year, we expect a lot of things to unfold and we are quite excited for these to happen. 

As we have stated, we rather have a close mouth about these developments not to telegraph our punches along the way.

Whatever, it is enriching to have our dear readers follow our way as we envisioned for betters day of the Bohol Sunday News in the future.
