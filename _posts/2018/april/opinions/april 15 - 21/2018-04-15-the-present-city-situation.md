A friend of mine arrived from the States for the May fiestas in the province. She commented of what she saw in Tagbilaran.  She was appalled by the congestion of people on the sidewalks  and the numerous  cars on the  streets. She did not expect Tagbilaran seems to be a replica of traffic jams in Manila, Tokyo and Los  Angeles in America. 
When she arrived in Bohol in the early 60â€™s, she said she could strut and walked like the steps of the Majorca de Boholana. Tagbilaran  was stress free as there were only few people and cars, she said. Tagbilaran is bursting on its seams now.

Early this year, traffic problems were first felt by motorists when the main streets like the CPG Ave. and the Gallarres  Street were made into one-way streets. It has aggravated now that some streets are being closed due to reconstruction purposes.  We hope that the inconvenience would just be temporary and would not last long into the fiesta day of Tagbilaran.

This writer found out that automobile dealers made an average of more or less 500 cars for their annual sale. Imagine the volume of annual sales in a span of five years and the congestion it would generate. Remember the city streets are not getting bigger and wider every a day.

One of the cause of traffic jam in the city are the parked cars along the side of the streets. If the one hectare vacant lot behind the Muslim CD stalls located across the Alturas Mall will be converted into a parking area  as it is owned by the grandparents of City Mayor Baba Yap, problems  where to park  would be partly solved.

Let us encourage the mayor to ask his parents to invest in a building designed for a multi-level pay parking for cars and motorcycles at the aforementioned location. Or he would look for investors for this type of business who have a heart to help Tagbilaran with profits as secondary only in his personal agenda.     

Or is it time now that Tagbilaran must have an underground transport system like a spider web beneath the city streets? Or we have a futuristic monorail that blankets the city ahead of its time? Does the city need overhead foot bridges in strategic places and would people use them?

The city needs planners now that foresee the future.  They would come up for solutions of  the present problems before they will blow up in proportion too hot to handle. The time to act is now. 

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Be careful of what you heart desires.
