This summer and the coming months, we have the opportunity, as believers, to do something concrete in acknowledging the Lordship of Jesus Christ in our lives. Keep praying.

Here’s how: Our petitions are, to pray for peace in our personal circumstances, in our national situation, and in our world conditions. It is easy to do this. Every 6:30 in the morning, at noon, and 7:30 in the evening, pray the prayer that He taught us, The Lord’s Prayer. Do it in the privacy of your room or anywhere else, silently, in your mind and heart. No loud prayers, please, unless you are praying together as a group. If you forget and miss the time, just do it as soon as you remember. No compulsion. No worries. Just do it.

SIN DOES NOT PAY. Macau is a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China. The island-grabbing atheist-communist government of China decided to allow prostitution, gambling and drugs in that place to gain more profits. Today, Macau is known as “the world’s sin city”. But the latest pertinent CNN business report indicates that Macau is among the worst performing economies in the world. Indeed, sin does not pay.

THE PHILIPPINES HAS THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER IN ASIA. And health activists assert that these are the usual culprits: preservatives found in food, pharmaceuticals, house cleaning materials such as dishwashing liquids, and cosmetics. The advice given is, “read the labels of your food, medicines, house cleaning materials and cosmetics and do not use those that contain the following chemicals: quarternium, paraben, triclosan, triclocarban, cadium, mercury, polychlorinated bisphenyls (PCBs), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and bisphenol A (BPA), among others”.

We are truly living in troubling times. That is why, it is imperative that we continue to pray fervently.
