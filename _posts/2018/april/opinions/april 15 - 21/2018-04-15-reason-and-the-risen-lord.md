2nd Sunday of Easter (cycle B)
Readings:	Acts 2:32-35; 1 Jn 5:1-6; Jn 20:19-31

Imagine that you are blindfolded and there is a bucket in front of you and you are asked whether it is empty or full without removing the blindfold.

There are three ways you can learn in determining whether the bucket is empty or full without removing the blindfold.
One way is to reach into the bucket and feel of there is water in it.  In other words, you can experience firsthand if the bucket is full or empty.  This way of learning is called experiencing.  It is knowledge that we acquire by firsthand experience.  It is knowledge that our senses give us.

A second way to learn if the bucket contains water or not is to drop an object, like a coin, into it.  If the object hits the bottom of the bucket with a loud or ringing sound, you know the bucket is empty.  On the other hand, if the coin hits with a slurp or a splash, you know the bucket contains water.  This way of acquiring knowledge is called reasoning.
A third way to learn if the bucket contains water is to ask someone you trust.  The person could look into the bucket and tell you if it has water in it.  This way of learning is called believing.  It is knowledge that we acquire by faith.
In life we acquire knowledge by experiencing, by reasoning, and by faith.

Interestingly, of these three ways of acquiring knowledge we usually acquire most of our knowledge by believing what others tell us.  Some experts estimate that we learn as much as 80 percent of our knowledge by believing.  For example, few of us have travelled around the world.  The only way we know about most countries is by what others tell us.  In other words, we trust the people who have been there.  If they tell us there is a country called China and that its people do this or that, we believe them.

What is true of the way we acquire regular knowledge is even more true of the way we acquire religious knowledge.  Most of our religious knowledge comes to us by believing what the Scriptures tell us.  In other words, most of our religious knowledge comes by believing.

Now let’s consider this question: can we acquire religious knowledge by the same three ways that we acquire regular knowledge?  For example, can we know that Jesus rose from the dead not just by believing what Scriptures says but also by reasoning?


Some people think we can and their explanation is fascinating.  They begin by pointing out that after the death of Jesus, his disciples were completely distraught.  They were a defeated group of people.  They were a discouraged group of people.  They were a frightened group of people.  Then on Easter Sunday, something happened to these distraught, discouraged, frightened people.  Something transformed them in the most remarkable way imaginable.  Something changed them is an amazing way.

Suddenly they literally exploded with joy and happiness.  They couldn’t contain themselves.  Off they went to tell everyone they met that Jesus was risen and alive.  So convinced were they about this that they readily suffered the most terrible kinds of persecution, and even death, rather than deny their risen Lord.  The lives and preaching of this handful people changed the course of human history.

No acceptable explanation has ever been given to explain their transformed lives – no explanation but their own: they had seen Jesus alive.  Had these unlearned people lied about Jesus and his resurrection, it is reasonable to assume that sooner or later one of them would have confessed under the pressure of persecution or death.  But none did.  Their witness to the risen Jesus never wavered.  Their witness never weakened in the least.  On the contrary, it grew stronger and more powerful.  They even experienced an amazing new power that allowed them to work miracles.

It is this unexplainable transformation of the followers of Jesus that leads some people to say that reason itself testifies to the resurrection of Jesus.  In other words, pure logical reason dictates that something spectacular happened on Easter to transform the followers of Jesus.  Pure logical reason dictates that the resurrection of Jesus really happened.
