On Thursday, April 10, the Bohol Sunday News will be marking its 3rd anniversary as a local community newspaper.

There was no hullabaloo when this paper had its maiden issue last April 10, 2016 as everybody was too busy for the 2016 presidential and local elections.

We did not even get the usual welcome comments from the other media sources in Bohol. It seemed that we feel being a lone ranger.
We took advantage of the situation when our first issue hit the streets as news sources were aplenty and a wide array of possible political ads as it was the height of the campaign then.

Correctly, our rag-tag army did not came scarce with news sources. But our marketing agents could hardly level with the existing competitors although this paper directly hit the break-even level on its first month.

Our supporters, sponsors and advertisers kept us going although there were times that we are about to throw the towel.

Perhaps it was due to our passion to become an independent sources of news which do not see print with other publications.

It looked like a one-man army as we endeavoured to start the ball rolling and indeed we managed to complete the initial stage.

In the interregnum, we learned bad and good lessons but we forget the bad ones and focused on the good ones. There was no pat on our back as we continued to survive the challenges of newspapering.

At this stage, we thank the Philippine Press Institute (PPI) for lending us its credibility and source of strength as we continue to earn our spurs on our third year of existence as an independent Boholano newspaper.

Next month, we are set to receive our regular membership from the national association of newspapers after a year of being a probationary member.
Frankly, we did experience that our achievements were just whispered by our critics and opponents and shouted our failures.

As we enter the next chapter of our existence as a local community newspaper, major developments are on its way though we have to be secretive about it.

In the meantime, just sit back, relax and enjoy reading this paper. That is part of earning our spurs at our third anniversary without any fanfare.
