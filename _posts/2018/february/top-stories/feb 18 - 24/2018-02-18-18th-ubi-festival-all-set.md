TAGBILARAN CITY - The three-day 18th Ubi Festival is all swet on Tuesday next week after it was postponed from late last month to an indefinite date due to additional preparations made for the affair.

The launching of the festival is to be led by Bohol Gov. Edgar M. Chatto and the Department of Agriculture 7 Director Leo Cañedaset to be held at Plaza Rizal on Tuesday noontime.

This year’s festival is themed “Ubi, HamilingLagutmonIkapasigarbosamgaTuristasaTanangPanahon.”
A motorcade from the Plaza Rizal to Island City Mall is scheduled after the ubi exhibit’s ribbon cutting.

A program is to be made inside the mall where local ubi growers, non-government organizations and representatives from the academe gathered.

Larry Pamugas, acting provincial agriculturist, said that 24 localities with potential for ubi growing are expected to send delegates to join the festival.

These areas include Tagbilaran City, Baclayon, Dauis, Panglao, Albur, Lila, Jagna, Dimiao, Duero, Alicia, Talibon, Ubay, Calape, Antequera, Maribojoc, Cortes, Balilihan, Carmen, Sikatuna, Mabini, Corella, Sevilla, and San Isidro.

Like with previous Ubi festivals, activities such as an ubi eating challenge, literary musical contest, cooking contest, the judging for best ubi booth and indigenous crop production technology will be held during the event.

The Ubi Festival is celebrated annually in Bohol as recognition to ubi growers across the province since 2000.
