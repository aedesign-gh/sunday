Bohol conferred a posthumous award to the late multi-awarded movie and television director Maryo delos Reyes for giving pride and honor to his province and country in culture and arts.

By his works, the film guru from Alicia town had Bohol contributing to the Philippine show business and performing arts an institution. 

Gov. Edgar M. Chatto signed the award from the provincial government in time for the necrological service for the famed Boholano motion artist in Quezon City.  

The remains of the filmmaker---who was born Mario Margarito Jorolan delos Reyes---were cremated and inurned at the Himlayang Pilipino in Quezon City last Saturday, February 3. 

At 65, he died of heart attack while attending a birthday party in Dipolog City on the night of January 27.

A day before, a resident of Habitat Village in Bool, Tagbilaran City named Jongjong Engay was hired to install additional lights at the townhouse of Delos Reyes.

The director was supposed to go to Bohol from Dipolog City and stay for a while in Alicia before proceeding to Manila.

Engay was shocked to hear in the morning of January 28 the news of Delos Reyes’ sudden death.  
The governor had Lutgardo Labad, also an award-winning Boholano artist, taking charge in handing over the province’s award to Delos Reyes’ younger brother, Manuel.

Chatto apologized to Manuel he could not come for the necrological rite and personally present the award due to the wake of his mother-in-law, the late former Tagbilaran City Kag. Primitiva Veloso.
Veloso, also a former dean of the Holy name University, died a day after Delos Reyes’ death and was laid to her final rest last Wednesday.

She is the mother of the governor’s wife, Balilihan Mayor Pureza Veloso-Chatto, and Tagbilaran City Vice mayor Jose Antonio Veloso.

The province and the governor were represented in the Delos Reyes rite by lawyer Lucas Nunag, Jr., chairman of the Provincial Tourism Council, Fr. Val Pinlac, artist-historian Marianito Jose Luspo, Bohol Association of Metro Manila officer Giegy Gudito, actress Lilet, and Labad.

The ceremony was coordinated by To Farm Film Festival executive producer Dr. Milagros Ong-How with the help of Delos Reyes’ manager June Rufino.
