More than 15,000 athletes all over Central Visayas will gather here starting on Feb. 24 for the Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (CVRAA) 2018 meet.

The athletes, accompanied by their coaches and chaperons, will be billeted in various city schools during the entire sports activity which will wrap up on Feb. 28.

This prompted the city police force to beef up security preparations at this early to provide the necessary security for the participating athletes.

Superintendent PatricioDegay Jr., city police chief, said around 500 policemen will be deployed in key areas including sports venues for the CVRAA which are mostly located in this capital city.

Local policemen from various municipal police stations in Bohol will also be tapped to augment the cityâ€™s police force, Degay said.

Senior Superintendent Angeles Genorga Jr., newly-installed PNP provincial directorof Bohol,ordered various police stations in the municipalities where CVRAA activities will be held to also start security preparations for the week-long sports event.

Degay said that Genorga also ordered municipal police chiefs to deploy additional personnel in tourist spots which will be visited by the athletes togetherwith there coaches and chaperons.

Genorgawanted the same stringent security measures implemented last year for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meetings in Bohol to also be applied during the regional sports activity.
