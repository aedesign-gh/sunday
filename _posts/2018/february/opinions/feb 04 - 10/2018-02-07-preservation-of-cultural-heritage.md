There was an old hexagonal two-storey stone brick building at the tip of the ancient wharf in Maribojoc town. Large square stones were piled one on top of the other to support the second storey. A vignette of leaves were carved on the stone door jamb. The door panels were made of thicksingle slab of a local hardwood. The second floor had large windows with lattice as walls for free movement of air and to withstand strong winds from the sea. It was constructed during the Spanish period.

It would never be known why the Spaniards constructed the building: As a lookout post for marauding Moroslike the Watch Tower in Punta Cruz, a barangay in Maribojoc,oras storage of Boholano goods waiting for shipment to Acapulco, Mexico?

The building was already abandoned in the 60’s when I was a child. It had seen better times during its heyday when Maribojoc was the port of entry to Bohol before the Tagbilaran and Jagna ports were created. The building was a relic of Spanish influence in Maribojoc.

Then the late Mayor Jacinto Rubillar wanted to resurrect the glory days of Maribojoc in the 40’s by extending its wharf hoping the ships of the Rolling Mills Factory in Cortes town will dock there. The Spanish building had to give way to the wharf’s extension. The stone bricks where thrown to the sea and the hardwoods were chopped for firewood by the residents whose houses lined the causeway.

Had the National Historical Commission (NHC), the then National Historical Institute (NHI) been present in the 60’s, the ancient building would have been spared from demolition.
It is a pity that historical structures are torn down in the name of progress without regards to its historical and cultural values. Historical structures are our heritage from the days gone by. Theyare our mute witnesses to our local history ought to be preserved.

Let us give thanks to the Marcos couple, the former Pres. Ferdinand and his wife Imelda, who created the NHI. The NHI is responsible for the management and preservation of historical sites, shrines, statues and buildings around the country.Nowadays  one can no longer tore down an old building of historical value without NHC approval.

The presence of NHCand the National Museum is visible these days after the Oct. 15, 2013 Bohol earthquake. They worked hand in hand to renovate, reconstruct and retrofit Spanish churches and buildings. Had strengthening on these old structures been done before the earthquake, perhaps these buildings would still be standing all these days, or had minimal damage.
