For the last two days since Friday, we have been hostage by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) held at the Bohol Tropics Resort this city.

The registration fee is quite high but we cannot do otherwise as its attendance is mandatory for a practising lawyers like us.

Senior lawyers are asking for a discount of the registration fee but apparently the Supreme Court does not recognize senior citizens and their privileges.

Ditto for the next Friday and Saturday as the MCLE continues with the same schedule from 8 o’clock in the morning to 6 o’clock in the evening.

However, our snacks and lunch are provided for. Many of the participants take the MCLE seminar as a respite from the rigid law practice.

The MCLE committee in Manila has devised ways and means to enliven the seminar by inviting lecturers who are not only proficient of the topic they discuss but are at the same time provides for entertainment like jokes, especially the green ones, so that the participants will not find it boring to listen to discussions the whole day.

At the opening last Friday morning, our first lecturer is Atty. Kit Villasis who gave us an update on Remedial Law.

One topic which struck us was on the Ultimate Objective Test enunciated in the cases of Gochan vs. Gochan and Copioso vs. Copioso by the Supreme Court.

This test differentiates a real from personal action. 

For a layman’s understanding, in a personal action, the complainant seeks the recovery of personal property, the enforcement of a contract or the recovery of damages.

Real actions, on the other hand are those affecting title to or possession of real property or interest therein.

In accordance with Section 1, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court of the Philippines, the venue of real actions shall be the proper court which has territorial jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated.

The venue of personal actions is the court where the complainant or any of the principal plaintiffs reside, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendant resides.

But in the cases above cited, an action for specific performance, which is supposed to be an action incapable of pecuniary estimation which jurisdiction primarily resides with the Regional Trial Court, is now considered a real action where its seeks the conveyance or transfer of real property, or ultimately, the execution of deeds of conveyance or real property.

This is basically an application of the ultimate goal test. Strip of the legalese, this test therefore abandons the traditional distinction between personal and real actions to be brought into our courts.

Well, this could mean nothing to ordinary lay persons, but to us in the legal circle, this could bring a huge impact in our interpretation of the actions that we will file in court.

At any rate, we survived the first two days of our MCLE seminar last Saturday afternoon. We will soon have the second batch next Friday and Saturday as legal works here will come into a still as lawyers will once again troop to the Bohol Tropics Resort whether voluntarily or involuntarily.
