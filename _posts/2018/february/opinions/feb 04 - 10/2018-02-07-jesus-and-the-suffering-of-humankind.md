5thSunday of Ordinary Time (cycle B)
Readings:	Jb7:1-4, 6-7; 1 Cor9:16-19, 22-23; Mk1:29-39

All of us, at some time or another, have asked ourselves why the world is plagued by so many calamities, injustices, wars, diseases, disappointments, exploitation, and the like.  Something else puzzles us too: we often see upright people experiencing a lot of suffering, while everything seems to go fine with wicked people who have healthy families, enjoy success and prosperity.  Is this right?

The book of Job, in the first reading, discusses a problem that has distressed the people of all times: why are there so many people in the world who suffer?  The story of Job has been written to help us reflect on such a problem.  He was a very religious person, always well-behaved, and yet he was struck by an endless string of calamities.  The reading today contains his comments on the sad condition of humans in the world.  Starting from his dramatic experience, he says that life is all sorrow.  A person is like a “slave” forced to undergo immense privations without getting anything in return.  When Job looks at his condition, he says that his life is even worse than that.

Why did God allow Job to fall into such a desperate state?  Why did God allow Job to be born if he was to experience only misfortune and pain?  Job is not resigned; he does not suffer in silence; he gives vent to his sorrow in front of God and boldly asks him to explain the reason for his afflictions and calamities.  His cry may frighten us and may sound like rebellion and blasphemy.  And yet, it is really a deeply touching prayer.

In our gospel today, Mark tells us of Jesus’ first meeting with human suffering and misery.  This is his reply to the desperate cry of Job: it is no use blaming God for the sad condition and misery of people on earth.  The only attitude we can adopt is to stand by the sufferers and fight evil with all our abilities.

Jesus comes across the mother-in-law of Peter who was in bed with fever.  Jesus approaches her, takes her hand, and helps to stand up; as soon as she is up, she begins serving them.  As soon as they tell him about the sick person, Jesus immediately goes in to see the suffering one.  Is this how we behave?

The second gesture of Jesus is even more important: he takes the mother-in-law of Peter by the hand and “helps her up”.  This is not just a reference to what actually took place; in the New Testament this expression is used for “resurrection”.  So what Mark wants to teach us is quite clear: the sick person lying in bed, unable to move, prisoner of illness, is the person who is the victim of sin or the one burdened with some inhuman situation (disease, injustice, oppression…).  One day Jesus approaches this person, takes him or her by the hand repeating the gestures of his or her Master: to get near to those who have no strength to stand and help them out of the unhappy situation they are in.

The third detail (the healed woman begins to serve Christ and his apostles) is also significant. It is an indication that whoever is healed, whoever has experienced liberation, must forget the miracle that the word of God has worked on him or her, he or she must once more become an active member of the community.

Jesus did not teach us to work miracles; he did not solve all the problems of the people of his time.  He only posed some significant gestures to show us that God is not indifferent to the miserable condition a person is in; he does not like to see anyone suffering, oppressed, rejected.  He is on the side of those who do not resign themselves to misery.  By curing the sick, Jesus shows that his coming has initiated new world from which sorrow and suffering have to be banned.  The kingdom of evil, that is, all that hinders a person from being truly human, has been challenged and defeated.

What can we do to foster the creation of new humanity?
