BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

I dream of the day when Filipino voters choose our leaders because they believe and work for the principles for which their political parties stand for. Not because they received money, favors or even jobs. And yes, of course, I am dreaming. Nevertheless, I will continue to dream.

Let me contribute towards this end by presenting to you the principles of the two biggest political parties in our country today, the PartidoDemocratico Pilipino or PDP and the Liberal Party or LP. I am sure not many Filipinos ever bothered to check what these parties really stand for. So, may I help you?

The following are the officially written five basic party principles of the PDP:  “Theism, Authentic Humanism, Enlightened Nationalism, Democratic Centrist Socialism, and Consultative and Participatory Democracy”. Since I do not and cannot speak for both parties, I will not attempt to explain what these principles mean. That’s for you to research and discover. The PDP is currently led by Senator Koko Pimentel as party president and PresidentRodrigo Duterte as its national party chairman.

The LP principleswere enunciated during its national convention in 1947, thus: “To be a Liberal means to fight hard for what he believes in, but concedes to those who disagree with him, the right to fight in a like manner, as long as they are fair. The true liberal believes that there is such a thing as truth, and it can best be determined in a free and open contest for the allegiance of men's minds. The true liberal believes that while the people may not always be right, they are usually right, and that in the end, if the people are given free rein to choose and select, righteousness, truth, and justice will prevail. The true liberal believes in progress toward the goals of peace, justice, and freedom. He believes in the greatest good for the greatest number. He believes that men can be led to happiness and prosperity, but neither terrorized nor driven toward those goals. The true liberal believes in reason and enlightenment rather than in fear or superstition; in judgment rather than passion; in debate rather than in intrigue”.

The LP is currently led by its party president, Senator Kiko Pangilinan, and its national party chairperson, Vice Pres.LeniRobredo. 

Are you for PDP or LP? Do you understand these principles? If not, now is the time to start thinking, rethinking, reflecting, and not just vote because of money, favor or privileges. There are many other political parties in our multi-party system. We shall try to present their principles, too, when time and space permit.
