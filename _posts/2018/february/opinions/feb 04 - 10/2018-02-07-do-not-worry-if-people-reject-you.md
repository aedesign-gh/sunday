The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Feb. 4, 2018-Sunday) Mark 1:40-45”And a leper came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, "If you are willing, You can make me clean." Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.

Leviticus 13:45-46”As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and cry, "Unclean! Unclean!" "He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp. Sometimes we feel like this leper since we experienced also different rejections in life. Some people hate us and no interest to associate with us. This is the reason we feel loneliness in life. Bear in your mind, the leper suffered from double pains: physical sickness and internal sickness. Internal sickness means the agony of not loved and respected. The status of not valued by the people around us. I am sure that you have experienced this many times because there are people in the society you live who never treat you a dignified human being. Supposedly, you deserve to be loved and cared as a special creature of God but you are failed to have that in your life. Despite of this reality, imitate the leper who came to Jesus for healing and acceptance. Do not worry if people reject you because our God could not do that for you. He loves you the way you are and even who you are in the eyes of the world.
