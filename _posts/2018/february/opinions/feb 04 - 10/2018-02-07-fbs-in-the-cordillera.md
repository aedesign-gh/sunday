FBS in the Cordillera
(Last Part)

The five-day learning visit to some of the CHARMP2 (2nd Cordillera Highland Agricultural Research Management Project) areas has exposed what good the Farmer Business School can do to the economic life of farmers especially the upland community, something that our own upland farmers can learn from and decide to also adopt.

But more than our observation of the FBS benefit, the travel from Manila to Baguio has exposed to non-Luzon residents how development has been stepped up in that part of the country to the sacrifice of those in the Visayas and Mindanao who have been left out.  I envy the people of Luzon for the boon of having Presidents coming from that place for indeed they have been taken care of – at least in so far as the road and bridge infrastructures that interconnect the urban and the rural areas.  We are all aware that infrastructures like these are economic progress triggers.

Let’s just talk of Northern Luzon.  Their national highways are four to six concreted lanes.  The provincial, municipal and barangay roads are paved. We thought that skyways are only found in the metropolis.  No, they also abound in Central and Northern Luzon. Even the mountain foot trails in places our participants to the learning visit went to are paved.  The lesson we learned? 
Blessings are aplenty when you have the highest leader coming from your island/region/province/city/municipality. It makes you think twice what to do in the next election.
It is high time we consider seriously the proposed change in our form of government and not just leave it to the politicians to decide for us.

Anyway, back to the FBS.  Learning visits or the more popular term Lakbay-Aral may have earned a bad connotation because many lakbay-aral trips were abused.  Like travels of government officials and employees were also called lakbay-aral but actually they were really junkets.  The one we had in some of the CHARMP2 areas in Buenguet and the site visit of FBS groups in Tarlac and Pampanga was really a learning visit arranged and coordinated by the International Potato Center (CIP) and the FoodSTART+.
As I mentioned in the first part of this column, the FBS approach was developed and pioneered by CIP in 2008 through a project supported by the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) that aimed to link vegetable farmers with markets in Indonesia and later, with funding from IFAD known as FoodSTART, helped partners in the Philippines adapt field-tests and scale out FBS to farmer groups in the Cordillera particularly under 2nd Cordillera Highland Agricultural Resources Management Project (CHARMP2) of the Department of Agriculture in the Cordillera especially Benguet province.  Thus FBS is relatively a new approach and strategy to improve the plight of the farmers.  But good results are already seen where it was pioneered in the Philippines and it is high time that other farmers like those we have in Bohol adopt and practice it.

For a start all we need to do is train facilitators who will diligently go and organize the farmers to attend the FBS learning modules and guide them identify commodities that can be easily linked to value chain.  The learning modules include, among others, business planning and market analysis. With the Department of Trade an Industry, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Science and Technology collaborating to help our farmers, the idea of making farmers become entrepreneurs is not farfetched.

Today farmers should no longer be satisfied with just producing for their own needs but produce more so that their excess raw product could be processed and marketed at much profitable price.  There are so much opportunities that farmers can anchor their FBS on.  First, the province of Bohol is an eco-tourism destination.  That already is a big market that cannot be left alone to the big players.  The cultural activities in the province such as fiestas, and festivals, anniversaries trade fairs offer and provide unlimited market. Then there is the “build buildbuild” program of the Duterte administration that will open vast areas to commerce and industry and provide the environment for better market opportunities.  And lastly, government has recently enunciated a policy that junk food would no longer be allowed to be sold in schools.  This is something that organized farmers can take advantage of to produce healthy foods for the children in school and earn extra income in the process.

One other thing, women participation is the key to the success of FBS in the Cordillera.  It should also be here in Bohol.(For comments, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
