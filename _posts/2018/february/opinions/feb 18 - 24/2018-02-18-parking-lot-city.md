Parking lot city
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

When I was young, my friends and I used to sit by the side of the asphalted highway along the Poblacion in Dimiao, Bohol. We cracked jokes and sometimes shared a gallon of tuba at night when it was cool. We could hear our own giggles as we teased each other about our bad hairstyles and someone out of tune singing harana to a pretty bakasyonista.

Today, it would be fatal to do so. Fatal, not because of tuba or the sintonado singing, but fatal because the roads are cemented and there are more cars and buses running along the highway at any time of the day.

Meanwhile, many mayors have come and gone in Tagbilaran City. They each have their own legacy to speak of. But it was only recently that the city streets got cemented, and the faucets of Uptown Ubujan have running water the whole day.

The other side of the picture presents a problem though. In the olden days, Tagbilaranons were nonchalant about the fact that they could park their vehicles infront of their houses and it was okay. Not anymore, Sano. Nowadays, it is very difficult to negotiate the cemented roads of our only City of Friendship. Anywhere in the city seems to have turned into a huge parking lot.

Indeed, new roads require new lifestyles. We cannot continue to walk along our highways as if they are extensions of our sala, nor standby their sides and expect no accidents to happen. We must run when traversing by foot in a highway. As the usual expressway signage in Metro Manila puts it: Huwagtumawid, nakakamatay.

We cannot continue to park our vehicles infront of our houses in Tagbilaran City. We must get used to paying for parking lots. It is good for business. It is good for employment. It is good for the economy. It is good for our health, too, to walk a few steps more to get to our destination.

Gone are the days of MB Liner and St. Jude Transport that would wait for us while we take a bath. We must adjust. And we must keep the stray animals off our roads. But thatâ€™s another topic for another Sunday.
