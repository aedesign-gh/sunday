Here is a system of collaboration between physicians and or the hospital itself in a certain hospital:

Sometimes in 1998 my mother complained that her head seemed full and her neck was painful. We asked a neighbor who was a barangay health worker (BHW) to take her blood pressure. The BHW told us to take our mother to the hospital in Tagbilaran as her pressure was quite abnormally high.

We were taken care of in the hospital. Soon my mother underwent a battery of tests, x-rays, EKGs. And the verdict was this: my mother had stones on her urethra which is one of the causes for her high blood pressure. She had to be operated immediately which terrified us. Can it be true that stones caused her blood pressure to rise up, I asked myself silently.

We asked the doctor if there was an alternative to the open up surgery as my mother was already in her 70s, or any medicine to dissolve the stones?

The doctor said there was no other option but surgery and we had to deposit P80,000 at once to the hospital.

We were in a quandary where to get instantly that amount. My mother abhorred the idea of a surgery and decided at once to check out from the hospital which gave us a relief as we would be spared from the already exorbitant bills out of the different tests.

The thought that our mother had stones in her body gave us malaise. So we decided to ask for a second opinion from an endocrinologist in Cebu.

We were mesmerized by the shiny and state-of-the art facilities of the hospital in Cebu. And to cap it all, they were all in digital dimension which our hospitals here were not yet. Surprisingly, the hospital bills were not expensive. The doctor’s consultation fee was just comparable to the doctor’s asking fee in Tagbilaran. Out-of-town patients were given priority as they had to take the boat back to their respective provinces.

The results of the x-rays were read to us the next day. The doctor said there was nothingto worry as the “stones” were just grits and smaller than the mongo. It was an accumulation of alkali which is not deleterious to the body. She gave us a prescription which could be filled up at the downtown pharmacy. She said the medicine could cleanse the urethra of the alkali build up. When we went to the pharmacy, and to our relief, the small white tablet was only P6.00!
Had I had the money to deposit, my mother had been dead by now.

When I went to the doctor because my right foot was swollen which I suspected was arthritis, the doctor forced me to admit that I had been drinking wine lately, who would not take no for an answer that I was not a wine drinker.

The doctor prescribed me a strong dosage which relieved the pain. The menthol oil in a canister with a roll on tip gave me allergy. She advised me to see another doctor to have my liver and kidneys x-rayed if they had not been affected by my swelling and to bring the x-ray film on my next visit to her clinic. 

I could not help sharing this to my beloved readers:

My great grandfather was ashealthy as a baby at 104 years old. When he slipped on his granite floor hitting his head with a bang, my aunt insisted he had to undergo for a CT scan. He had refused, but my aunt kept on harping him that ultimately he gave in. Being healthy he refused to be wheeled in and walked by himself to the admitting room. Then he underwent the customary system of laboratory tests of the hospital.

He went there for a CT scan, but the findings was he had pneumonia so he was advised to be admitted in. My grandfather refused to stay in the hospital. He was given a medicine to be administered with hypodermic needles at home. He was not tested at the hospital for allergy of the medicine that when he was injected with the formula, he bloated that caused his untimely death.

What is the hidden agenda between doctors? Why is it they will refer you to another doctor for other ailments other than what you complained for? Take for example my situation why I am referred to another doctor for my liver and kidneys?  And the pneumonia of my great grandfather who came only for a CT scan?
