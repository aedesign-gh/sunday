The Agora

In planning we usually say “don’t leave any stone unturned.” Meaning, every aspect of whatever is being planned should be considered and reviewed before the activity is closed if we want it to attain its goals and objectives.  Nonetheless during the implementation period, the plan is being revisited to see if it is still up to current realities and whether it needs revision or enhancement.

Gov. Edgar M. Chatto’s State of the Province Address (SOPA) took the same platform of planning.  He did not leave any stone unturned.All aspects and facets of governance had a report of accomplishment and that was good.  Boholanos and would-be investors can look at the present state of the Province and say that their future is at least secured and investors can look at the report as a green light to start investing in Bohol. But just like a good plan, the report on the state of the Province must be revisited every now and then to see whether the guide posts and parameters are still the same.

Some observers commented why the governor still included the accomplishments of other agencies that are clearly not under his direct control and supervision. But since it was a state of the Province that he was reporting it would only be well and good that he also reported the accomplishments of other agencies to give Boholanos a holistic view of its current affairs.  What would be wrong is if he claimed those as his accomplishments, which I did not hear he did.

The Governor’s SOPA was the sum of all his eight (8) years in office.  Definitely one year’s accomplishment would add up to the previous years.  And so if we look at this year’s SOPA as a benchmark for next year’s accomplishment which would be his last since it would be his 9th year in office, I have four (4) areas that I will suggest to improve on.

First is in power.  A stable power supply may be the first or the last in the checklist of investors besides being the dream of every Boholano every time they experience power black-out due to the nature of our power supply that is still coming from Leyte thru a submarine cable. No matter the assurance that any shortage can be addressed by the power barge now moored in Ubay, that assurance will be just like the yellow traffic light to investors who could provide thousands of jobs to our people in the island.

The Bohol Energy Advisory Development Group (BEDAG) that was created to specifically look for ways and means to address the power requirement of Bohol, cannot and must not drag anymore whatever action is necessary to establish an island-based power generation in Bohol.

Second is in tourism.  Pres. Duterte has already warned the local government and the tourism establishments in BoracayIsland to shape up or pack up when he told them they would be charged with gross negligence (for LGU officials) or close their business down (the establishments) if they cannot restore the healthy environment in that world renown destination. 

The President’s warning may as well be meant for the tourism players of Panglao Island.  At the close of the year last year, DENR and DOH have announced that the e-coli content of seawaters along the Panglaobeaches has exceeded the tolerable limit.  The white sand beaches and pristine waters of Panglao being the number one tourist attraction cannot be compromised.  When the seas get dirty, the first to disappear will be the dolphins and the sea turtles.  Then the tourists will disappear next.

Third is in agriculture, particularly rice production.  We have always boasted that we have attained rice sufficiency in the Province.  The goal should no longer be sufficiency for the Province.  We should scale up so that we could help feed our neighbouring provinces if not other provinces.  The term rice granary of CentralVisayas should mean providing rice to the other provinces of Central Visayas.

TRAIN (Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion) has already increased the price of rice even in Bohol.Let usnot wait for imported rice to raise it even higher.  We still have a lot of lowlands that can be converted from grass or brush lands to irrigated rice lands. Our agricultural techniciansshould be in the field helping our farmers produce more and not stay in the office. The 100-120 cavans of rice per hectare target is already very low and can be increased by technology that our farmers should be taught and encouraged to adopt and practice. 

Fourth is in peace and order.  The only reason why progress has been steady in all areas is because the province has maintained and sustained the insurgency free status that was earned in February 10, 2010. It was also the green light signal that investors were looking for to come in.  But lately, sightings of NPAs in some parts of the province have been reported.  It means it is high time to improve and innovate on old strategies and programs to keep them out of our island.  That they have returned and vowed to organize two (2) guerrilla fronts before the 2019 elections means that they have studied our “weapons” and have found the antidotes to their effects.

These are just four (4) that came to my mind as I listened to the SOPA.  Our dear readers may have more which can help guide our planners for next year’s accomplishment.
