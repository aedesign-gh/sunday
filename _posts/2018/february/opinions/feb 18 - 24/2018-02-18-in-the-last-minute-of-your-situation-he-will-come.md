The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Feb.18, 2018-Sunday) Mark 8:1-10” I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat. 

"If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance." And His disciples answered Him, "Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?" And He was asking them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "seven."

Hebrews 3:8”Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. The only move you can do is to come to him no matter what. The people refused to go home although they knew their insufficiency materially because of their happiness within that this world could not give. This is true, only in God we can find genuine happiness. Not money and earthly possessions in life. People gambled everything just to follow Jesus in the wilderness. There were rewarded by Jesus in forms of healing, miracles and the food they had eaten. To be good it pays.

Ephesians 6:8”knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. Prove your love to God and he will do what is right for your life. Seek him first every day and do not give up your interest to him. 

Matthew 6:33”"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. This is my realization of this gospel, if you have nothing to do anymore for your life and only God is your last recourse, he will rescue you and do the rest for your sake. Imagine, the people could not do anything except their trust to Jesus and believing that Jesus will not forsake them. Believe in God that in the last minute of your situation, he will come to do something better for your life.
