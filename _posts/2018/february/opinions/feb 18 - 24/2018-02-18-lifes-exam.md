1stSunday of Lent (cycle B)
Readings:	Gen9:8-15; 1 Pt3:18-22; Mk1:12-15

The season of Lent is a time in which we are invited to reflect our sinfulness and ask for God’s mercy and forgiveness.  On this first Sunday of Lent we will see that to sin is a failure to pass a certain kind of test.  By itself temptation is not an evil thing.  In English the word "tempt" has a uniformly and consistently bad meaning. It always means to entice a man to do wrong, to seek to seduce him into sin, to try to persuade him to take the wrong way. But the original Greek word “peirazein” has a quite different element in its meaning. It means to test far more than it means to tempt in our sense of the word.

One of the great Old Testament stories is the story of how narrowly Abraham escaped sacrificing his only son Isaac. Now that story begins like this in the King James Version "And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham" (Genesis 22:1). Quite clearly the word to tempt cannot there mean to seek to seduce into evil. It is unthinkable that God should try to make any man a wrong-doer. But the thing is quite clear when we understand that it means: "After these things God tested Abraham." The time had come for a supreme test of the loyalty of Abraham. Just as metal has to be tested far beyond any stress and strain that it will ever be called upon to bear, before it can be put to any useful purpose, so a man has to be tested before God can use him for his purposes. The Jews had a saying, "The Holy One, blessed be his name, does not elevate a man to dignity till he has first tried and searched him; and if he stands in temptation, then he raises him to dignity."

Now here is a great and uplifting truth. What we call temptation is not meant to make us sin; it is meant to enable us to conquer sin. It is not meant to make us bad, it is meant to make us good. It is not meant to weaken us, it is meant to make us emerge stronger and finer and purer from the ordeal. Temptation is not the penalty of being a man, temptation is the glory of being a man. It is the test which comes to a man whom God wishes to use.

Temptation is a challenge that enables us to test how firm we are in our choices.  All the great people of the Bible had to endure temptation: Adam (as we heard in the first reading), Abraham, Job.  The Gospels tell us that Jesus also was tempted at the very start of his public ministry.  Mark does not expand on the point, he simply states that Jesus was tempted.  Matthew and Luke, on the other hand, describe at length the temptation and speak about three ways the forces of evil used to turn Jesus away from his saving mission.

This Sunday, we hear of Mark’s version.  Mark refers to the temptations of Jesus very briefly and uses to verses to explain them.

We immediately notice a strange fact: it was the Spirit who, soon after descending on Jesus, drove him to the place of temptations.  Was this a good thing?  For us ‘to tempt’ somebody is to incite that person to do evil, and God certainly cannot do this.  Yet, in the Bible we often read that God put humans to the test.  How can we explain this?

In life there are temptations that are not incitements to do evil: they are just situations that everyone, even the just person, has to face.  At such times we are invited to take a stand and thus strengthen our faith.  All people who want to grow, improve, purify themselves and strengthen their contact with God cannot avoid these tests.  They even welcome them.  What happen to us on the day of our baptism?  We receive the Spirit (yes, the same Spirit that came on Jesus).  Does it mean we are from them on miraculously preserved from all life’s difficulties?  Are we freed once and for all from doubts, anxieties, and preoccupations?  No, soon after our baptism and as we grow, the Spirit drives us into the ‘desert’ of life, just as it did with Jesus.  It wants the baptized person to experience joys and sorrows, fears and hopes like all other people.  It is in the world, in contact with our daily problems that our faith, continually tested, will grow as it responds to the Spirit’s inspiration.
