While the commentators are awash with saliva in discussing about the pros and cons of the new traffic set-up in downtown Tagbilaran, in our experience as a driver, we come up with a set of rules while driving in city streets.

With a one-way highway, not street, because it is the CPG Avenue that we are talking about, from the Capitol down to Visarrastreet, never take the left portion of the road because of the presence of the kings of the roads, the tricycle units.

With due respect to some courteous tricycle drivers, majority of the tricycle units are like the horse-driven “tartanillas” – they are bullish with their direction especially if they are picking passengers, who in turn are like toddlers in schools.

What really made the situation in downtown Tagbilaran awful, is due to the tricycle passengers who wanted every delivery to be in a door-to-door basis.

People here do not like to walk. But in other area like in Cebu and Manila, people there are obliged to walk. There is no door-to-door delivery there.

This is the mentality of the people sojourning in the city. They think that the city is too small to deserve some kind of respect in our traffic rules.

Secondly, those who owned cars and SUVs also have the same mentality with tricycle passengers, they also like the door-to-door delivery and wanted to park right in front of the establishment that they have an appointment or transactions.

This is what made our traffic situation in downtown Tagbilaran too congested and messy.
Parking in city streets just like in the downtown area should have been absolutely prohibited. The clamping system cannot help as owners of houses located in the area who do not have parking areas love to park their vehicles in the street.

This includes owners of business establishments who do not have parking areas. They also love to park their vehicles right in front of their own establishments.

So the next thing that we will do is not to bring SUVs if you maintain an office right at the downtown area. If you insist on driving your SUV on a working day, better seek a parking area like a mall or other private parking areas in order not to contribute to the traffic mess that we are in.
It is better to bring a light vehicle to that you can easily park and can easily maneuver while in the downtown area.

Do not ever, ever pass the street fronting the St. Joseph Cathedral when a mass is about to close. You will be stuck there for more than 30 minutes to one hour due to the traffic of the churchgoers crossing that unnamed city street in front of Plaza Rizal.

The same is true for the start of classes and the dismissal at the Bohol Wisdom School. Never, never pass that area during these times. The parents of the students who always exhibit their new cars are also bullish with their directions whether to turn left or right. They seem to be unstoppable believing that they are above the rest because of their new cars and SUVs.

If you go shopping, better use the parking spaces of malls rather than park your vehicle in front of the grocery store even during night time for 24-hour stores.

Lastly, once your vehicle is already parked correctly, better walk if you have other appointments in other establishments rather than tag along your vehicles with you.

If you will not heed this advices, your better park your vehicle at home and take the multicab or the jeepney in going to downtown area. If you can refrain from taking a tricycle, the better, except when it is raining.  But the only solution there is an umbrella. Bring one when it rains.
