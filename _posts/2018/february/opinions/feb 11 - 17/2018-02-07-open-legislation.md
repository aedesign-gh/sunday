BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

I am referring to the program of Open Legislation under our Provincial Government of Bohol through the leadership of Governor Edgar Chatto, Vice Governor DioningBalite, Acting Vice Governor BenjieArcamo, SangguniangPanlalawigan Members, Chiefs of Offices, Civil Society, and Business leaders.

Open Legislation is a platform for participation through social media, more specifically Facebook. It is a commitment aimed to create more spaces for engagement to further improve the local legislative process. A highly accessible and transparent local government through open legislative processes will increase the citizens’ participation through public awareness and spaces for engagement between the public and the government.

By providing an alternative platform for the citizens to be engaged in the local legislation process, this further improves the participation of the citizens in the decision-making process of the local government. In effect, this also improves the access to information that will directly affect the citizens.

This alternative process will supplement the current offline legislative events such as committee hearings and public assemblies. Having an online platform, specifically through social media, the citizen’s interest on legislation will improve and in effect improving the citizen’s participation. Social media, such as Facebook, is a more accessible medium for the citizens as 40 million Filipinos, including thousands of Boholanos, have active Facebook accounts.

Inclusion of citizens in the process of legislation shall open up opportunities for engagement and effectively improve policies crafted. Elected officials will also be well-informed of the people’s ideas and reactions.

How? Use your authentic personal Facebook account with your true name. Click “Join” in the group called “BOHOL – SangguniangPanlalawigan”. When you participate, do not criticize without presenting a better alternative. Do not engage in political intrigue. The purpose of the page is local legislation, not intrigues. Be constructive, not destructive. Make a positive contribution to Bohol’s policy-making.
