 The Gospel of Jesus Christ ( Feb.11, 2018-Sunday) Mark 8:11-13”The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him. Sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, "Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation." Leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side.
 
 There are many times that we have the same mentality with the Pharisees because we ask God every day for more evidences that he is alive. You never understood that the day you have today is a miracle already for you to celebrate.On the other side, faith is a vital element for our salvation. No faith means denial of God. Hebrews 11:1”Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. In my case, I am always praying to God to increase my faith because there are times that it is hard to believe his existence in my life. I reached to the point of doubtfulness that’s why I asked him to intervene in my mind. Luke 17:5”The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith! Pray to God for more faith. Pray for more strength that even adversities could not decrease your faith to Him. Bear this in your mind; sometimes we can think that God is absent and quiet in all your prayers and intentions in life but no, he is just watching you struggling because he believes you that you can handle everything.
