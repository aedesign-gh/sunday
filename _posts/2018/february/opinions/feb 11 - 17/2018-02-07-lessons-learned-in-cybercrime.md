Well, we practically survived the four-day Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) in order to comply with the sixth compliance period as mandated by Bar Matter No. 850.

Most of the participating lawyers to the MCLE seminar has to egged out an average of P8,500 as registration fee plus the fact that they lost the opportunity to have an income especially those from the towns who also have to spend for their accommodations and billeting in the city.

Of course, there are some lawyers who were able to maneuver and made their city-based law offices as in business as usual through their legal staff.

We were part of those lawyers who still managed to operate their law offices while participating in the MCLE seminar.

For one, we wrote for our daily news contribution to the Manila Bulletin and have them published the following day. Thatâ€™s an income for us provincial correspondents.

Secondly, we capitalize the Saturday schedule to write articles for this paper and forward it to the traffic.

To those lawyers who are regular fixtures of the MCLE seminar, we find some of the topics repetitious and sometimes, boring.

However, we cannot skip attending the lectures as the Supreme Court-based MCLE monitors are very strict in our attendance.

However we found one topic to be very interested as well as the lecturer who is witty in the person of Usec. Erickson Balmes of the Department of Justice who is among the well-loved lecturers of the MCLE here.

Balmes discussed about cybercrime in relation to an update to the Internet and the social media.

He said that our cellular phones is the gateway to Internet and we should be very, very careful about its usage. We should not make our cellular phone as the main data of our existence, otherwise, we will be hostage to our mobile phone.

For one, we should refrain from availing of free wireless fidelity otherwise known as Wi-Fi either provided for by the government or by private entities. It is just a give and take process. We can avail of the free Wi-Fi and at the same time, it will also use us.

If will have our own Wi-Fi connections, we should not avail of the applications it offer or visit the porn sites nor give our credit card numbers and our personal circumstances.

In other words, refrain from joining the information highway in the Internet whether it is through social-media and the blogs.

We have been warned about the repercussions of the Facebook and its origin, Friendster. We will be opening up ourselves to all forms of cybercrimes.
