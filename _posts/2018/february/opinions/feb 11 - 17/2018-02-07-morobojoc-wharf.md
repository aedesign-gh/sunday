In the 1980’s, there was only one ship plying the Cebu- Tagbilaran route and vice versa. She left Cebu at 12 noon and arrived 4 pm on the same day. She departedTagbilaran at 12 midnight and arrived Cebu at 4 am. The ship was the ever listing to portside M/V Sweet Heart of the defunct Sweet Lines Shipping Co.

In one of its trip from Cebu, I was on the gallery watching the outline ofMaribojoc, when a foreigner came to stand beside me. He struck up a conversation by telling me that the blue sea is only 300 meters deep, the deepest a scuba diver can reach.  I asked why he knew. He said he was a consultant at the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) head office in Manila.

I pointed out at the distant the needle-like structure made of concrete at our ancient wharf which a red glass lantern was lighted every night, and asked if our wharf could be operational again. He said: the PPA had condemned it as a dead port, and added, have you seen a person who had risen from the dead?

Last Sunday, Fr. Gerardo Saco, parish priest of Maribojoc, before he gave the final blessings of the mass he had officiated whispered something to a lay minister as he gestured at the back of the congregation. The lay minister turned to look at where Fr. Saco was pointing and it turned out Cabinet Secretary LeoncioEvasco, Jr. attended the first mass. Fr. Saco wanted CabSec to say something to the parishioners who willingly obliged.

CabSecEvasco disclosed that the Maribojoc dead port will be resurrected to become the largest state-of-the art container port in the Visayasregion patterned after the sophisticated wharf in Hongkong, China. Hesaid he had personally made a representation at the PPA head office asking that the Maribojoc wharf could be open again for merchant ships. 

He revealed that the bidding for the project was already finished. The four-lane causeway that leads to the wharf would cost around P30 million while the wharf itself has a whopping budget of P600 million with reserved spaces for refrigerated containers.

The former mayor stated that it is the desire of the old folks of Maribojocthat the gaiety and glory of the CompaniaMaritima days in the 1940’s would be back again to the town. And he wants the wishes of the old people will be realized.

CabSec gave the congregation a bird’s eye view of his work in Malacanang, even though it was already way past going home time, but the people were still very attentive to what CabSecopened up. When he said Fr. Saco was also like a town mayor because of his countless projects, the congregation burst into an applause with many who blinked a tear.
