The cat is finally out of the bag: both the military and the police authorities here confirmed last week that elements of the underground movement are now operating in Bohol particularly in its interior area.

Although Gov. Edgar M. Chattosaid that the report remains to be verified during his weekly radio program, “Kita ugangGobernador” broadcasted live from the Governor’s Mansion in the city.

The governor said the armed groups will not triumph in planning to enter the province and carry out crimes that state forces and vigilant residents would not allow it.

The confirmation of the Philippine Army here regarding the presence of the New Peoples Army (NPA) members particularly in Sevilla town doused cold waters to the claim of former brigade commander, Gen Arnulfo Matanguihan that Bohol is insurgency-free.

But Col. Ignacio Madriaga, the new commander of Bohol-based 302nd Infantry Brigade claimed that the province still meets the conditions in order to be deemed insurgency-free.

Madriaga explained that only a few barangays claimed to have NPA movements and the communist guerrillas roaming around in the province remain very low.

However, he admitted the presence of NPA organizers in the province and projected that the communist group would try to re-establish their presence in Bohol.

CONFIRMATION BY THE POLICE

The confirmation by the police force in Sevilla last week said that unarmed NPA rebels conducted house to house visitation.

A group of at least three men who claimed to be NPA members visited several houses in a remote village in Sevilla in an apparent effort to gain sympathy from residents.

According to SPO4 CrikitoCurayag, acting police chief of Sevilla, the men knocked on houses and shared their thoughts on the government and rising prices of basic commodities to villagers including a councilor of Barangay CalinginanNorte.

There were no visible long firearms in the possession of the men, Curayag said.

“Tulolangkonoangmosakasabalayperodihaymgakaubannganamatikdangnaasagawasnagpaabot,” Curayag revealed.
The barangay councilor, whose identity was being withheld, said that the men who claimed to be NPA members visited his house at around 6 p.m. last Jan. 29.

Curayag said that although the men claimed to be members of the NPA, they could be representatives of a non-armed faction of the rebel group.

“Mga NPA, kompirmado man judkaybisanang 47th IB nikompirma pod sila, basi pod sasinultihanugnilihukanmailhannga NPA sila,” said Curayag.

Following the incident, the police started to coordinate with the Philippine Army’s 47th Infantry Battalion and launched joint patrols in remote areas of the town, Curayag added.

THE ARMY ALSO CONFIRMS

After reports surfaced indicating that NPA rebels visited several houses in Sevilla to gain villagers’ sympathy, the Philippine Army confirmed the presence of members of the communist group in the insurgency-free province but clarified that they are mostly unarmed “organizers” of left-wing organizations.

Madriaga said that these organizers are out to gain sympathy from residents and ultimately re-establish a stronghold in the province where NPA activity was at its height in the 1990’s.

“Hindi konamanipagkakailana may presensyangmga NPA perohindiitomga local, yungibagalingsamgaibanglugarperoito ay mga organizers,” he said.

Madriaga also supported the statement of the Sevilla police which indicated that the group of men who talked to residents of Barangay CalinginanNorte and shared insights on the government and rising prices of basic commodities in late January were NPA organizers and not armed rebels.

“Halos parehas kami ng police [information] kasinagpapalitan kami, may intelligence exchange kami,” Madriaga concluded.
