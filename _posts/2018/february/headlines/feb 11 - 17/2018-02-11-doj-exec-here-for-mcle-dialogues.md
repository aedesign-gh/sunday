Used. Erickson Balmes of the Department of Justice (DOJ) arrived here last Friday to lecture on the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) and hold a dialogue with the provincial and city prosecutors.

Balmes also turned over livelihood kits to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Bohol chapter headed by Atty. Warren Yap for a joint outreach project here.

More than 120 Bohol lawyers attended by MCLE seminar held last Feb. 2-3 and 9-10 held at the Bohol Tropics Resort. The registration fee was P8,500 while IBP lifetime members and early registrants were given a discount of P8,000.

Balmes lectured on four major topics during the MCLE seminar.

In between, Balmes presided over a dialogue with city and provincial prosecutors where he emphasized the need to have a separate DOJ building here which will house the national prosecution service, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Bureau of Immigration.

The DOJ undersecretary revealed that the NBI will soon be issuing a unified clearance to applicants applicable to all endeavours.

Balmes is a familiar fixture of MCLE seminars here for his witty delivery of lectures.
The MCLE seminar here is in compliance of the sixth compliance period from 2018 to 2001.
