ANDA.- Mayor Angelina "Inday" Simacio of this town already filed a motion for reconsideration last week on her indictment of graft charges by the Ombudsman.

Speaking through her counsel, Atty. Antonio D. Arabejo, the town mayor also sought for a reconsideration on the administrative charge suspending her for three months for simple neglect of duty. 

Simacio’s indictment was for allegedly initiating the construction of an overpriced multi-purpose center in 2013 for which she was charged for violation of Section 3(g) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act otherwise known as R.A. 3019.

Simaciowas found to have approved the construction of the Anda Multi-Purpose Building worth P2.5 million which was awarded to A.S.O. Construction.

The Ombudsman said the funds for the project came from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) of former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile.

The Ombudsman cited an Audit Observation Memorandum issued by the Commission on Audit on October 7 last year declaring the project as overpriced by as much as P754,517.36 and ordered A.S.O. to refund the amount to the local government.

“The excessiveness is due to the high labor cost which is higher than the normal and usual practice in construction, and an overestimated quantity of reinforcing steel bars,” COA said in the memorandum.

"If anything, the refund is an indication that the contract was truthfully disadvantageous to the government,” the Ombudsman added.

The anti-graft body further said it is "convinced that the contract entered into by the LGU with A.S.O. Construction was manifestly disadvantageous to the government."

"This is regardless of whether A.S.O. Construction indeed refunded the amount of P754,517.36,"" the Ombudsman said.

The Ombudsman saidSimacio is liable for the offense, being the town's local chief executive responsible for the approval of contracts and disbursement of funds.

“Respondent, being the Mayor of the LGU at the time of the execution of the contract, was the head of the procuring entity. She signed the contract, which incorporated the bid documents including the Bid Prices and Bill of Quantities and the Detailed Estimates," the Ombudsman said.

"Moreover, she caused the disbursement of P2,498,923.50 based on the Accomplishment Reports submitted by A.S.O. Construction, which she notably approved. Clearly, she is not beyond reproach,” the Ombudsman said..

Section 3(g) of the anti-graft law penalizes public officials who are “entering, on behalf of the government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to same, whether or not the public officer profited or will profit thereby.”
