A multi-sectoral group issued a manifesto last week opposing the planned coal-fired power source in the province.

The manifesto was sent to the SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol and was tackled during the presiding officerâ€™s time by Acting Vice Gov. Vinzencio B. Arcamo during its regular session last Friday.

Emilia M. Roslinda, executive director of PROCESS-Bohol and president of the Bohol Association of Non-Governmental Organization (BANGON) formally sent the manifesto toArcamo last Jan. 24 yet.

The manifesto against the use of coal for power generation in Bohol was signed by members of the organized citizens groups, faith-based organizations and environmental advocates from all corners of the province.

The signatories claimed that they have to take a firm stand against whatever plans and machinations there might be to utilize coal in generating power within our province.

The manifesto based its opposition on the following grounds: coal is dirty, costly and deadly
Arcamo immediately referred the manifesto to a joint committee composed of environment as the lead committee and the public utilities, peace andorder and the committee on public safety andhealth.

The joint committee is expected to conduct a meeting next week and may invite resource persons to shed light on the matter.

Arcamo said he hopes to have the committee report as soon as possible in order to make the recommendations of the provincial board to the office of the governor.

Among those who signed the manifesto include representatives of the Bol-anon United Sectors Working for the Advancement of Community Concerns (BUSWACC), Bohol Initiators for Sustainable Agriculture and Development (BISAD), Integrated Midwives Association of the Philippines (IMAP) and BANGON.

BonifacioQuirog Jr., SP secretary and columnist of this paper also signed the manifesto as a civil servant and an environmental advocate.
