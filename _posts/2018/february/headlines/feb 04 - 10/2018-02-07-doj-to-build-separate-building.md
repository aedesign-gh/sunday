The Department of Justice will soon construct its own new separate building apart from the Hall of Justice.

This was disclosed by Provincial Prosecutor MacarioI. Delusa in an exclusive interview with the Bohol Sunday News yesterday.

Delusa showed a written memorandum addressed to the provincial and city prosecutors here regarding the plan.

City Prosecutor Romeo M. Chatto also confirmed the plan of the justice department to construct its own building in the city.

The memorandum said that DOJ will facilitate the construction of the national prosecution service building through the Department of Budget (DBM).

“As initial documentary requirements, the Deed of Donation of the lot and the building plan, with costing, will be submitted”, it added.

The documentary requirements will be sent directly to DOJ Sec. Vitaliano Aguirre through Usec. RaymundMecate. 

The supposed deadline is on Jan. 31 but Delusa said it has been extended in order to accommodate the later comers.

The building will house the provincial and city prosecutors office, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) ansd the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID).

Delusa said he will set an appointment with City Mayor Baba Yap and Gov. Edgar M. Chatto together with the city prosecutor in order to map out the possible site of the DOJ building here.
