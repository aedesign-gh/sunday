3RD DISTRICT Cong. Arthur C. Yap yesterday said he will consult the local party directorate of the PartidoDemokratiko Pilipino-Lakasng Bayan (PDP-Laban) in Bohol at the right time.

In his message with the joint induction of the Association of Writers and Radio Announcers of the Philippines Inc. (AWRAPI) together with three allied cultural groups at the JJ’s Seafood Village, Yap said he will make the necessary consultation with the local leaders and members of the party regarding his future political plans.

The third district solon recently took his oath as member of the dominant political party before House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez together with former Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who is now a congressman of Pangasinan.

Earlier reports said that Yap has an eye for the Bohol governorship after he will end his term as representative in the third district. He ran for the post uncontested in 2010, 2013 and 2016.
