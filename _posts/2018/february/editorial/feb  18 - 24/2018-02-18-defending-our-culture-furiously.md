The national president of the LubassaDagangBisaya (LUDABI), Atty. Leo Zaragosa, delivered an impassioned speech during the 40th joint induction ceremony of the Association of Writers and Radio Announcers of the Philippines, Inc. (AWARPI) and its three allied associations last Saturday evening at the JJ's Seafood Village this city.

To the uninitiated, Zaragosas speech is nothing but a speech especially to those who do not have a sense of nationalism and culture.

But for us who re-joined the group two years ago, Zaragosa’s speech sent us into a level of deep thinking.

He wanted the Bisayan-speaking people to start a revolution for the re-integration of the dialect which has been long neglected.

We just realized how we even scandalized the word LUDABI into a “lumbasadagangbisaya” during our college years.

As we continue hearing the updates of Dr.Jes B. Tirol, one of our leading linguists in the country today, we started to  realize that our dialedt is now in the brink of annihilation. It has become an endangered species.

Cong. Arthur C. Yap of the third district, who was among the guests during the event, correctly lamented that we should defend our culture furiously noting that countries who display a deep sense of nationalism like Japan, Germany and Italy including South Korea are now manufacturing vehicles.

The tourists will be coming more often once the Panglao airport hopefully starts to operate within this year. Our dialect will be part of the marketing instead of learning their own language.
Tourists go to Japan, Germany, Indonesia and even China who cannot even speak English because their language is part of the marketing.

It is high time that we should highlight the Bisayan dialect in our communications with tourists, both local and foreign. Signs must be multi-faceted.

This is the way how we defend our culture furiously the way it should be.
