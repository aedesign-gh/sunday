We reserve this article dedicated to Maria Ressa, the woman behind the online publicationRappler.
We have nothing against Rappler nor Maria Ressa except that the latter has a questionable appearance on what kind of gender she have.

At the outset, let it be clear that we don’t like the Ressa’s superiority and the yellow inclination of Rappler particularly PiaRanada and her cohorts.

But according to the Wikipedia, Ressa was named the the “sexiest woman alive” by the Esquire magazine and explained that despite her size, fearless enough to write an eye witness account of Al-Quaeda.
Speaking of fake news, Ressa and Rapper accused that there were thousands of fake news during the campaign of Pres. Duterte.

However, there were several account of fake news being propagated by Rapper in its reports.

When the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) stripped Rappler of its corporate existence, many, including us, laughed. The SEC decision declaring Rappler to have some foreign investments did it in.
Rappler cannot question the wisdom behind the decision. The SEC chairperson is an appointee of former Pres. Pnoy Aquino, Teresita J. Herbosa.

But the unquestionable brightness of Ressa who thinks that she and PiaRanada are better that the President, retorted back and put a political inclination behind the SEC order.

Worst, the yellowtardsthen put a spin to the issue and described it as an affront to press freedom. The netizens quickly dismissed free freedom from the issue.

Rappler plainly violated the Philippine Constitution which mandates that press outlets must be 100% Filipino owned.

We are pretty much sure that Rappler will bring its case all the way to the Supreme Court and expect a favourable decision from the en banc chaired by Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno.

Well, it is still a long and winding road for Rappler on its way to the High Tribunal. But we do certainly known how it will end.

However, along the journey, we all know that superiority of Ressa and her cohorts at Rappler over the Duterte administration has given a doze to its own medicine.
