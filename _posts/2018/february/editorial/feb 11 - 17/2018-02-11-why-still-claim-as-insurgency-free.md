In several issues back, we asked if there is a jinx whenever Bohol is already classified as no longer insurgency free.

Despite the tell-tale signs that it is the other way around, we cannot fathom why the military and the provincial leadership still claims that Bohol is insurgency-free.

Is there a maneuver why our authorities still made the claim?

On the part of the Philippine Army, can it be the promotion of the new brigade commander being at stake when he joins the chorus that Bohol is insurgency-free?

This is what Arnulfo Mataguihan kept on harping when he was still the brigade commander of the 302nd Army Brigade here. This has caused him to be promoted as a one-star general.

Despite the confirmation of the Sevilla police force on the presence of New People’s Army (NPA) rebels who made house visitations in the town’s hinterbarangays, Col. Ignacio Madriaga still claimed that Bohol still fall short on the conditions to be classified as no longer insurgency free.

Do we still wait when communist insurgents launch an armed offensive against the military or the local police before leaving the claim to be insurgency free?

Or is Col. Madriaga also on the same wave length with Matanguihan who earned his star while being assigned in the province? Just asking.

It now appears that an assignment in Bohol with a rank of colonel is a stepping stone for promotion.
Will the Boholano leaders allow the province to be prostituted by these Army officials in order to get their much awaited promotions while at the same time denying the fact that the NPA rebels are now back in Bohol.

Whether the NPA rebels are from Bohol or not does not weigh anything. What is more important is that we will accept the fact that the communist insurgents are already back here. Take it or leave it.
