Panglao airport contractor: projectis 74% complete

Chiyoda Mitsubishi Joint Venture, contractor of New Panglao International Airport on Friday said the project is now 74% complete.

A press release from the provincial government said the target date of the airport operation will be in August this year.

This development prompted the Capitol officialdom to be updated on the actual status of the airport construction and immediately motored to Panglao town. 

Gov. Edgar M. Chatto and the SangguniangPanlalawiganof Bohol headed by Acting Vice Gov. Vinzencio B. Arcamowent to the site and inspected its progress.

The decision to inspect the project came after the provincial board held it regular session Friday morning.

Majority of the board members went with the group and met the top officials of the contractor in the project site.

If plans do not miscarry, the start of airport operation is slated to be in August this year.

Meanwhile, the main bulk water supplier intended to boost the water supply in this tourism town already started laying the water pipes from its water treatment plant in Patrocinio, Cortes.

Richard Lim, president of Richli Corporation which is behind the multi-billion project, told Manila Bulletin Thursday night in Eskaya Resort here that the water pipelines will pass through the towns of Corella, Tagbilaran City and Dauis en route to Panglao.

Lim said the project is expected to be completed within six months although he said that the period will be reckoned from the time that the permits from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the concerned local government units are already complied with.
