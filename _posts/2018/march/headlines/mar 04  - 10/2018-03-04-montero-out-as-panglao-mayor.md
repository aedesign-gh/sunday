Ombudsman ConchitaCarpio Morales, after taking “a second hard look at the evidence, found Panglao town Mayor Leonila Montero guilty of grave misconduct and order her dismissal from the service.
The five-page joint order obtained by the Bohol Sunday News last Friday was signed by Morales on January 18.

It also cancelled her eligibility, forfeited her retirement benefits and imposed the penalty of perpetual disqualification to hold public office.

Earlier, Montero was suspended for three months without pay for simply misconduct without pay for appointing her party mates who ran and lost in the 2013 local elections to various positions in Panglao local government unit.

Augustin Cloribel, a resident of Barangay Lourdes, Panglao and known as a known critic, accused Montero for grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service before the Ombudsman-Visayas on August 14, 2015.

The complaint centered on Montero’s appointment of her PDP-Laban party-mates who lost in the 2013 elections – vice mayoralty candidate Noel Hormachuelos as municipal administrator/consultant for administrative services and candidates for municipal councilors, Danilo Reyes, public information officer and ApolinarFudalan as public employment service officer (PESO) coordinator and livelihood (Tesda) and Information Technology consultant.

Montero also appointed Fernando Penales consultant on infrastructure and engineering services who ran and lost as municipal councilor under the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA).

The original complaint for grave misconduct was downgraded to simple misconduct since there was no showing that Montero was motivated by corruption, willfully intended to violate the law or disregard established rules, according to the Ombudsman.

There are three lady Bohol town mayors facing charged with the Ombudsman under this term. 

They are Mayor Angelina Simacio of Anda, Mayor Nita Cubrado of Pilar and Montero of Panglao. Simacio and Cubrado already filed their appeals to the Ombudsman order suspending them from office.

Montero is expected to also appeal the order of dismissal against her as soon as she will received it.

Her vice-mayor, Pedro Fuertes, is currently the acting mayor of the town.
