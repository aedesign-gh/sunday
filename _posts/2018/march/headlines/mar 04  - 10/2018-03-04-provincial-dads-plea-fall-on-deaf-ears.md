The plea of Board Member Dionisio Victor A. Balite to reconsider the plan to reset again the holding of the regular session of the SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol from Friday last week to Wednesday and then from Wednesday to Friday last week apparently fell on deaf ears.

This surfaced after the provincial board approved last Friday in its regular session Board Resolution No. 2018-101 setting the session on Wednesday last week for being moot and academic.

The motion was approved en masse or by all the members present during the session.

The earlier resolution reset the regular session from Feb. 23 to Feb. 21 of the same time and venue, was done through the passage of a resolution, SP Resolution No. 2018-101.

Balite queried whether it also followedthat if such schedule is going to be re-set again, a passage of another resolution is in order on the ground that whether itis within the provisions of the Internal Rules and Procedures, as amended.

He also asked whether a majority of the SP members may just convene, as they wish, to come up with a consensus that will render ineffective a previously approved resolution like Resolution No. 2018-101.
The board member, who belongs to the opposition, also asked if the majority insists that the 3rd regular session of the SangguniangnPanlalawigan of Bohol be held on Feb. 23, instead of Feb. 21 as per Resolution No. 2018-101, whether that session be still rendered valid and legal.

But in response to the letter of the Hon. Victor Balite, we are of the view that there is no particular rule in our Internal Rules that is being violated; since the resolution has been rescinded, these issues have been rendered moot and academic according to Rule 11-18.

Balite hinted that he cannot attend the regular session last Friday as he was all set to join the national convention of board members to be held in Palawan.
