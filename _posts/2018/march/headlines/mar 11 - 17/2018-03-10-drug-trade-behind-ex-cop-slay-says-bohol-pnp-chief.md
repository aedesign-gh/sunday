Drug trade eyed on ex-cop’s slay

The provincial director of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Bohol eyed illegal drugs trade as behind the killing of a former policeman in Dauis cockpit last Thursday afternoon.

In a radio interview over Station DYRD last Friday morning, P/Sr. Supt. Angeles Geñorga Jr. said this particular angle on illegal drugs is being look into by police probers.
“Yung mga angle naitoangtinitingnannatinmunangayonbaka may conflict siyasamgaka-trasactionniya,” he said.

Zandro Angelo Zamora, who was a police officer 2, was dismissed from the service in 2016 for having tested positive for illegal drug use, added Geñorga.

The victim is believed to have also been involved in the illegal drug trade.

According to Geñorga, a BPPO task group was formed to lead deeper investigations on the case.

Zamora was gunned down by two bonnet-wearing assailants inside the Dauis Cockpit Arena while at least two other suspects were stationed around the area as lookouts.

The victim, 34 years old, is a son of a Punong Barangay Eugene Zamora of Taloto District, Tagbilaran City.

Based on initial police investigation, there were six suspects stationed around the Dauiscockpit arena in Barangay Totolan during the attack but only two bonnet-wearing suspects gunned down the victim.

Zamora arrived at the cockpit at around 2:30 p.m. Thursday afternoon while the two gunmen were waiting for him outside.

The suspect immediately shot Zamora when he arrived but the initial gunshots failed to incapacitate him.

Zamora ran inside the cockpit and asked for help from one of the attendants identified as Paterna Acuna, while the suspects chased him down. Acuna tried to block the gunmen from entering the arena but one of them shot her in the chest.

Meanwhile, Zamora reached the back end of the establishment but the suspects were able to catch up and shoot him repeatedly.

He sustained multiple gunshot wounds in his head and body in what appeared to be a carefully planned attack.

He died on the spot while Acuna was rushed to the Ramiro Community Hospital in Tagbilaran city but was declared dead on arrival.

Scene of the crime operatives later recovered five spent bullet shells near Zamora’s body while they also found a sachet of suspected shabu inside his pocket.

According to the Dauis police, they found two text conversations in Zamora’s cellphone which may be related to his killing.

Police said that Zamora conversed with an unidentified Filipino-speaking person who he only referred to as “Dong.”

Zamora reportedly was supposed to meet the unidentified texter to sell him a packet of shabu for P500 based on their conversation.

In another cellphone dialogue earlier on the same day, Zamora asked an also unidentified person if there were cops in the cockpit’s vicinity to which the texter replied that there were none.

However, at past 2 p.m., the same texter told Zamora not to proceed to the cockpit warning him that there were people waiting for him.

Authorities believe that Zamora was unable to read the text which may have caused him to still go to the arena despite the threat.

His father confirmed that his son already received death threats before the incident.
