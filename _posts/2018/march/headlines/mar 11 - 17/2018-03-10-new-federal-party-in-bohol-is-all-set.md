A new political party to be named as “Bol-anon PartidoPederal” is set to be organized here on Saturday during a forum on federalism.

This was revealed by an insider who requested anonymity in an exclusive interview with the Bohol Sunday News just before press time last night.

According to the source, top national personalities both in public and private, are set to grace the gathering to be held at the Booy Covered Court this city.

Among those invited is no less than Cabinet Sec. Leoncio B. Evasco.

The report also indicated that most of the recruits to the new political party here are members of the KilusangPagbabago(KP) all over the province.

It was also gathered that the convenors group of the new political party are set to invite new breed of local politicians who have track records of community service who cannot run as candidates due to lack of money.

The activity will start at 9 o’clock in the morning on March 10 and will wind up at 3 o’clock in the afternoon.

The same group has started the advocacy for federalism and temporarily formed the local chapter of AbantePederalismsaProbinsyanongBisaya (APProB).

PARTY FOR EVASCO

The source did not confirm whether this new political party will be the electoral group which will toss up Evasco as a gubernatorial bet in the local elections next year.
But the body language of the former Maribojoc town mayor seems to point out his gubernatorial plans next year.

Evasco was again in the public eye when he was the guest of honor and keynote speaker during the 149th Foundation Day in Carmen town last week.

Although his press statements is likened to his boss, Pres. Duterte, who may or may not run as a gubernatorial bet in the political exercise.

There were reports that the political enemy of Evasco, Cong. Rene L. Relampagos of the first district, may eventually be forced to run after the clique of Gov. Edgar Chatto-Relampagos-Cong. Art Yap will endorse the first district solon in the gubernatorial race.

Yap has openly declared that he will support Relampagos as a gubernatorial bet in the 2019 local elections and may just run as his tandem.

Chatto will just seek re-election as a congressman in the first district.

TWO OR THREE CORNERED FIGHT

Until today, there is no definite number of those interested to seek the No. 1 position at the Capitol.

One report had it that once Cong. Aris C. aumentado of the second district will throw his hat in the gubernatorial right, the race will become three-cornered.

But the younger Aumentado has not openly floated his gubernatorial plans although his leaders and think thanks are thinking otherwise.
Bu Aumentado’s situation is just like his possible contenders, Evasco and Relampagos-Yap tandem who did not issue any categorical statements on their intention to run for governor next year.
