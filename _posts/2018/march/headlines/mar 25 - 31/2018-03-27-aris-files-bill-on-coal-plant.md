COAL may be an energy source, but Rep. Aris C. Aumentado( 2nd District, Bohol) has registered his opposition to the idea.

He formalized his opposition by way of a bill he filed last week in the Lower House.
House Bill No. 7468 seeks to prohibit the exploration of coal and the installation of any coal-powered plants in his district and provides penalties for violators.

When found guilty, violators will be imprisoned for not less than one year but not more than six years, or fined not less than 100,000 but not more than ₱3 million pesos, or both - at the discretion of the court.

In his explanatory note, Aumentado said his stand aims to protect the natural resources of Bohol considering that the province’s prime economic drivers are tourism and agriculture.

Both these treasures, he explained, stand to suffer from coal plant operations. Many perfect cone-shaped mounds of the Chocolate Hills can also be found in Sagbayan town while Danao is proud of its adventure tourism.

Many towns in the district have been taking steps toward making the district Bohol’s first “Green District” by promoting the harnessing of renewable energy.

He said a coal-fired plant endangers the environment as the process entails the  emission of harmful substances to the environment to include, but not limited to mercury, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, selenium and arsenic. By themselves or
Coal’s by-products, he explained, causes pollution that in turn, contribute to global warming and climate change.

The prohibition, Aumentado added, is geared at protecting people from the negative and harmful effects of operating a coal-powered plant.
