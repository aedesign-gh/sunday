As the Catholic Church started its heightened campaign against divorce law, we go first to the equation on how Boholano solons voted on the law in the Lower House.

Cong. Rene L.Relampagos of the First District and Cong. Erico Aristotle “Aris” Aumentado of the Second District voted against the unpopular "Absolute Divorce Law" which was passed and approved at the Lower Houselast week.

The proposed law was principally authored by House Speaker Pantaleon “Bebot” Alvarez of Davao del Norte.

Both Relampagos and Aumentado expressed their sentiments during the deliberations that it is within the teaching of the church that strong family ties is within the ambit of vibrant bonding of parents and the family.

Hence, this law is farfetched to the church teachings. Strong family is also strong relation to God.

Though, this law approved by the House of Representatives, will face rough sailing at the Senate considering that majority of the senators identified with Pres. Duterteare vocal against the passage of the absolute divorce law.

For his part, Cong. Art C. Yap was not present when the voting took place in the Lower House.
