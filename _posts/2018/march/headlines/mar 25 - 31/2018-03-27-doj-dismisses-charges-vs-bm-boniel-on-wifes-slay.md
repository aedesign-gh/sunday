Don’t look now but Board Member Niňo Rey Bonielcould be on his way back to his seat at the SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol after being incarcerated for almost a year.

This surfaced after the Department of Justice in Manila dismissed the criminal charges against him and two others in relation to the alleged murder of his wife, former Mayor GisielaBendongBoniel.

A copy of the DOJ order was obtained by the Bohol Sunday News last Friday from the camp of the provincial legislator who is presently detained in Cebu City jail.

The order was signed by Undersecretary Reynante B. Orceo for and in behalf of DOJ Sec. Vitaliano Aguirre III.

The main discussion of the order was more on the jurisdictional issue ranging from the place of the crime and the jurisdiction of the city prosecution office of Lapulapu City.
On June 28, 2017, a resolution was rendered by the City Prosecution Office of Lapulapu indicting Boniel for parricide and for murder against Willy Hoylar and RestitutoMagoncia Jr.

Boniel filed a petition for review on the resolutions.

In ordering the resolutions to be set aside, the DOJ directed the city prosecutor of Lapulapu City to withdraw the information for parricide against Boniel and also for the withdrawal of the Information for Murder against Hoylar and Magoncia with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lapulapu City.

The DOJ order also directed the city prosecutor of Lapulapu to report any action taken within 10 days from its receipt.

With the withdrawal of the criminal cases against Boniel, his release from his detention is thus forthcoming.

Until today, the body of the lady mayor has not been recovered despite reports that her remains were thrown in the seawaters off Mactan Island in Cebu.

Her vice mayor, Rene Boniel, has assumed her position due to her absence after she was allegedly kidnapped and shot by her husband.
