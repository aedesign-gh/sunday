Above photo shows former agriculture secretary and now Rep. Arthur C. Yap of the third district driving home a point during the BISU-Candijay awarding of checks to 365 scholars recently at BISU-Candijaymulti-purpose hall. The third district solon said 'if you have the production, you must find a way to package, you must find a way to consolidate, you must find a way to deliver to the market. Go to the market. That is the problem in agriculture today. We do not look for the market. We wait for the market to come to us. Thats not the way it happens. When the market comes to you, it is the trader that makes the money. But if you find the market, you make the money'.
