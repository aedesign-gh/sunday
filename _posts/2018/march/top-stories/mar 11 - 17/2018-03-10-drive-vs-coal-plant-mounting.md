The campaign against the establishment of island-based power source using coal as fuel is gaining grounds.
s
Bishop Patrick Daniel Parcon of the Diocese of Talibon and Bishop Albert Uy, Diocese of Tagbilaran, are reported to be opposing the plan to establish of a coal-fueled power plants in the province, according to Clean Energy Advocates (CEA), a loose organization of non-government organizations, religious, academe and faith-based groups.

Trying to intensify its campaign against the move of the provincial government in considering coal-powered electric plant to be put up in the province, CEA has met with the bishops separately.

During the meeting, Bishop Uy expressed his stand against the plan as it might contradict with the vision and mission of the provincial government.

He said he will talk to Bishop Parcon to come up with separate campaign statement, saying “let’s walk the talk” with this endeavor.

According to EmmieRoslinda of PROCESS Bohol, one of the convenors of the CEA, saying that she is happy that Atty. Boy Nunag, ArgeoMelisimo, Atty. John Vistal and PENRO supported our advocacy. They in fact elaborated the potential effect when pushed through.”

Recently, CEA released to the media a statement interposing opposition to the coal plan for environmental, health and cost grounds.

As an opening salvo of the campaign, they organized the Bohol’s Forum on Coal Question held at Café Caloy in this city.

Earlier, the group has issued a manifesto strongly opposing the coal use in the future.
Coal, which is abundant and inexpensive, is responsible for carbon dioxide emission (45%) worldwide and some 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions from electric sector, NoelynDano said in her presentation during the forum.
