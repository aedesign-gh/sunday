Chatto, SP praise
KarenGallman

Gov. Edgar M. Chattopraised and congratulated Boholana mestiza Karen Gallman on her crowning as the Bb. Pilipinas Intercontinental this year.

The governor also thanked the Bb. Pilipinas 2018 candidate #38 for introducing herself to have come “from the Province of Bohol” during the coronation at the Smart Araneta Center in Manila Sunday night.

Chatto said Gallman did carry the name of her province with pride during the grand finale of the beauty pageant, which ceremonies lasted until 1am Monday.

The governor extended his greetings to the beauty queen and her Boholana and Australian parents.  

On Friday, the SangguniangPanlalawigan (SP) passed a resolution, introduced by Board Member Victor DionisioBalite, likewise congratulating the Boholana stunner, whose mother is from Ubay and father from Brisbane, Australia.

The SP session was led by Acting Vice Gov. VenzencioArcamo along with acting floor leader Board Member Tomas Abapo, Jr., also from Ubay.

Gallman will represent the Philippines to the Miss Intercontinental competition abroad this year.

The last Boholana to represent the country in an international beauty contest was Miss World Philippines 2006 Anna Maris Igpit from Panglao.

An analyst by profession after graduating at the University of Queensland in Australia, the 25-year-old Fil-Aussie beauty first competed in the Bb. Pilipinas six years ago.
The online “Norman’s Blog” site has this recall of her first Bb. Pilipinas try:  
“You will remember her as Binibini 1 of Bb. Pilipinas 2012 where she reached the Top 12 and was also named Miss Photogenic of the batch. Back then, Karen Gallman was a 19 year-old Fil-Aussie lass who takes roots from both Brisbane and Bohol. She was considered the one with the prettiest face of 2012 where Janine Tugonon eventually won the highest title of the night.” (VenreboArigo)
