hl-desc: "(Left) Gov. Edgar Chatto and Usec. Gloria Jumamil-Mercado of the Office of Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco, Jr. talk of the apppointment of  (right) PPDO Chief John Titus Vistal as an undersecretary. Jumamil announced during capitol’s monthly convocation program last Monday of Vistal’s appointment already signed by Pres. Rodrigo Duterte.  Like Mercado, Vistal is also an undersecretary to the CabSec but coordinating with 12 national agencies. However, a memorandum of agreement will yet be sealed between the Bohol government and Malacañang since Vistal will serve the national government as a “borrowed” officer from a local government unit.  This principle is termed in civil service as secondment.  The young capitol planning and development officer is known for his competence and dedication. Photo also shows Liza Quirog, the governor’s chief-of-staff. (EDCom)"
