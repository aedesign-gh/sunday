Obviously, Sen. Francis Pangilinan is no fan of Pres. Duterte.

At least, not after he successfully won a Senate seat with the support of Duterte, a support which he sought and got.

As one of the pillars (some now say remnants) of the Liberal Party, Pangilinan has very few compliments for the President.

This is expected, and he is well within his rights to be a staunch critic of his party's arch-nemesis.

So what happens when Sharon Cuneta, the mega-star herself, posts a photo of her brother right beside Pres. Duterte looking every inch like an adoring fan?

It sends people wondering whether anyone's listening to Pangilinan outside the yellow cult.

For sure, he has his own sympathetic listeners.

But if Sharon's post is any indication, it seems she has her own impressions of the President which, obviously, are different from those of her husband.

Couples, of course, do not always see eye to eye at all times so there will be those who see no problem with Sharon's post.

The fact remains, however, that as a politician, Kiko is expected to be an effective campaigner to win people over to him and his advocacies.

So for Sharon to virtually reject Kiko's contempt for Duterte by publishing no less than her - and her brother's - gushing admiration is an indictment of his shortcomings (failure is a brutal word although it is applicable here) as a campaigner.

Who's listening to Kiko?

Judge for yourself.
