Our charter provides who are the impeachable officials. They are the President, the Vice President, the members of the Supreme Court, members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman.

Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provided the grounds for impeachment. They are culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes or betrayal of public trust. 

Presidential immunity from being charged in court while in office is a doctrine recognized in most democracies, including ours. 

In a plethora of cases, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the doctrine that the President, during his tenure of office or actual incumbency, may not be sued in any civil or criminal case and there is no need to provide for this in the Constitution or in law as it is deemed inherent in the Office of the President.

Because of the “equal protection of the law” clause in the fundamental law of the land, the other officials listed with the President in the constitutional provision on impeachment are likewise immune from suit.

This doctrine of immunity for impeachable officials started as a mere tradition but it has always been followed and if it is shown that it has been abused, the Supreme Court could issue a ruling abandoning it.

The case filed by Atty. Lorenzo Gadon against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno against whom an impeachment complaint was filed with the House of Representatives more than  five months ago. 

The Lower House is set to conclude the impeachments hearings next week and will decided whether to reject the complaint or send it on to the Senate for trial. 

It has unearthed Sereno’s appointment of an official of the Philippine Judicial Academy, her failure to submit her Statement of Assets and Liabilities covering income earned before her court appointment, and even her low rating in a psychological test when the Judicial and Bar Council was considering candidates for chief justice in 2012.

The House Committee on Justice chaired by Rep. Rey  Umaliby now should have accumulated enough information needed for the House to decide on the impeachment charge against Sereno, whether she was indeed guilty of  any of the impeachable grounds.

If she should be removed from office after the Senate trial and she loses her constitutional immunity, she may well be charged in court on the charges raised against her during the many committee hearings.

During all these past five months, many quarters, including members of Congress and the Supreme Court itself, have been calling on Sereno to resign but she has resolutely decided she will face an impeachment trial in the Senate. 

After five months of hearings in the House, along with exchanges of press releases condemning and defending her, it is truly time to move on.

Let the Articles of Impeachment be sent to the Senate and let the trial begin.
