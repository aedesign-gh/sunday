Ex-City Mayor Dan N. Lim had always criticized athletic meets ranging from division, congressional, provincial and even regional levels because athletes only compose a little more than one-half of the entire sports contingent.

Most importantly, the other half of the sports delegation composed of coaches and chaperons also enjoy the same amenities of the athletes like the uniforms, free meals, transportation and billeting.
During his term as city mayor, Lim wanted to cut short the number of coaches and chaperons and would like to see a bigger number of athletes than the coaches and chaperons who are the public school teachers themselves.

We tried to look deeper into the composition of every athletic delegation just like the Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (CVRAA) that we are having right now in Tagbilaran City.
Out of the total 11,700 participants, there is only a little over 6,000 athletes. The others include coaches, officials and chaperons who are all public school teachers.

But for every delegation, each member is afforded with uniforms for the athletes, jackets for coaches, officials and chaperons.

The coaches must also be public school teachers handling each event being participated by the delegates whether it is by team or individual competitions.

The officials include referees, linemen, scorers and the like are also faculty members of the public schools being represented. The chaperons may represent the Parent-Teachers Association (PTA) and also the public school teachers assisting the athletes in individual competitions.

In other words, an athletic meet cannot move on with only the athletes, it should require the presence of coaches who may file protests and challenge the decisions but also the officials of the sports event.

This will be the rationalization of the formula for every contingent and delegation to an athletic meet.

Whoever came up with this composition and scheme must have come from the academe itself. Although it may require an extra-mile for public school teachers, but the benefits they may obtain may even surpass their efforts.

Well, this is the way that it should be.
