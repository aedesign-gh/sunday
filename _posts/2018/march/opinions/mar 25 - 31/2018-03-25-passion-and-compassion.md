Palm Sunday (cycle B)
Readings:	Is 50:4-7; Phil2:6-11; Mk14:1-15:47

The 2004 film, The Passion of the Christ depicts the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem.  It starred Jim Caviezel who played the role of Jesus Christ and was directed by Mel Gibson.  It gathered three Oscar nominations and twenty five film awards.

The Passion of the Christ gathered a lot of reactions, criticisms and controversy.  Some said that it was anti-Semitic, too exaggerated, too bloody, inaccurate, etc.  When Pope John Paul II saw the film before it would be released for worldwide screening, many people were eager to know his reaction and what would be his statement about the film.  The pope endorsed the film with five simple words, “It is as it was.”

The final twelve hours of Jesus was depicted with a lot of suffering and pain.  Many could not even bear the sight of it.  The title, The Passion of the Christs, has indeed captured the meaning of the word “passion”.

The English dictionary may describe the word “passion” as some kind of desire, an urge, a kind of rage or fury, some kind of fervor.  The meaning may have evolved, but going back to the origin of the word, it comes from the Latin “pati” which means to suffer.  In referring to Christ we use the word “passion” when we speak of his suffering.

This Sunday, aside from calling it Palm Sunday in commemoration of the triumphal entry of Jesus to Jerusalem, we also call this as Passion Sunday for we heard in our readings today how Jesus suffered.

The suffering of Jesus, which we recall in a special way today, has been a source of strength to countless people throughout history.  These people, could never have endured their suffering without the knowledge that Jesus had suffered before them and was now supporting them in their hour of trial.

As we look back over the suffering of Jesus, we see that he suffered in three different ways.

First, Jesus suffered mentally.  Jesus experienced this kind of suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane.  He sweat blood just thinking about the ordeal that lay before him.  Jesus also suffered mental anguish when his followers betrayed and deserted him.  All of us can relate to mental suffering.  Anxieties strike us and we worry too much.  In time of mental suffering, often the only comfort we have is the knowledge that Jesus suffered the same way before us and is now supporting us in our hour of trial.

Second, Jesus suffered physically.  He was brutally beaten, crowned with thorns, and nailed to a cross.  Again, we all relate to physical pain.  We have all experienced it, some more than others.  Again, in time of physical suffering, often the only comfort we have is knowing that Jesus suffered the same way and is now supporting us in our hour of trial.

Finally, Jesus suffered spiritually.  For example, as he hung helplessly on the cross, it seemed that even his Father had deserted him.  He prayed, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  Again, we can all relate to spiritual suffering.  There have been times when all of us have felt abandoned by God.

And so Jesus suffered in all three ways that a human being can suffer.  He suffered mentally, enduring the pain of betrayal.  He suffered physically, enduring the pain of torture.  Finally, he suffered spiritually, enduring the pain of abandonment.

There is a message here for all of us.  When we find ourselves suffering in one of these ways, we should turn to Jesus.  He knows how we feel, and he will not fail to strengthen us.

This is the meaning of compassion.  From the Latin “cum”, which means “with”, and “pati”, which means “to suffer”.  To be compassionate is to suffer with.  This is the God that we believe in, a compassionate God, who is very much willing to suffer with us.  He does not take away our sufferings, but instead He joined us in our sufferings.
