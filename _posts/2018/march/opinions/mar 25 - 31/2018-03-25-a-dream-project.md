The beams and girders of the renovated bridge on the entrance to the town proper of Maribojoc  will be put in place soon. The new bridge was designed to be high above the water for engine-powered watercrafts and floating restaurants to pass underneath.  The surrounding area of the bridge will be converted into a tourism estate patterned after the Golden Gate Bridge of San Fransisco, California, USA.

Last week some planning technocrats and engineers from the Bureau of Tourism surveyed the swamp upriver for its feasibility study of the area. After their inspection they were amenable the swamp could be a potential tourist attraction.

They would recommend for the widening of the river banks and dredgingits bottom for easier river traffic. They disclosed that along the banks will rise souvenir shops, restaurants, coffee shops, snack bars, internet cafes, boats and kayak rental shops or traveler’s lodge. There will be designated places for video key bars considering its noise.

The widening of the river will have its terminus at the BolokBolok Spring inBarangay Jandig. The spring is the source of water supply to the town proper of Maribojoc.  It gushed out a good volume of water in the old days. So high was the water pressure it used only gravity to distribute the water to the town proper. There were attempts in the past administrations of the local government to develop BolokBolok Spring, but were abandoned. With the new bridge, the development of BolokBolok Spring will be an aftermath and a reality of a long cherished dream.

As I am writing this piece it came back to me the first time I caught my first close up glimpse of then Mayor LeoncioEvasco, Jr., now the cabinet secretary of Pres. Duterte.  I had been hearing about him, but I did not see him as he was away for so long in our town, and in our age gap. 

One day, in a spur of a moment, some 10 years ago, I made a half day afternoon leave from the office. I asked a friend who was on his day off to go boating on an outrigger canoe we rented from a neighbor. Off we went sailing leisurely along the narrow river shaded by branches hanging above the calm water.

We chose a shady spot on the riverbank to dig for clams. Then the silence of the river was broken by a sputter of a boat’sengine. At first it was faint then became louder and closer. From a bend emerged those new flat bottomed fiber glass boats owned by the BantayDagat. Standing on the bow of the two seater boat was our mayor. I was surprised and elated because he greeted me by name. 

The mayor passed by us. We heard the boat’s engine went around the swamp. We were still digging for clams when the mayor went home as he waved at us. I was ashamed as I did not expect the mayor to see me in that situation.

At that time I thought the mayor just had his leisurely boat ride and see for himself for the time how the swamp looked like. But now it came to me he had inspected the swamp for what potential it holds for the town of Maribojoc.  Sooner an unspoken dream of a visionary mayor will be a reality.
