(We have to give way to this piece written by Chito A. Fuentes through his FB account about the possible Senate run of the national photobomber, Bong Go)
FOR a brief moment, it seemed like just another reunion of the Duterte presidential campaign team.

Among those present in the Wednesday gathering were now prominent names in the Duterte administration led by former senator and now Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano.

With so many familiar faces, what normally was a quick round around the cramped venue took longer than usual what with all the spirited pleasantries.

And yet, this was more than just another Wednesday and not just a mere reunion.

Those present took time out from their busy schedules because of one singular purpose: to convince Special Assistant to the President Christopher "Bong" Go to vie for the Senate. 

Go was conspicuously absent, as always on duty to the president nearly of those gathered at the Ilustrado Restaurant in Intramuros worked to install.

Despite his physical absence, however, Go was the man of the hour - a sharp departure from his usual role as the do-it-all sidekick of the country's highest official.
This time, Go was placed on the spotlight by those who believe his entry into the political arena would complement what is already an over-achieving presidency.

The man who has often been relegated to a mere acolyte to perhaps the most unconventional, unorthodox and unpredictable president quite naturally feels uneasy with all these.

The vote of confidence not only from the president's trusted allies and supporters but President Rodrigo Duterte himself is something that is hard to come by in a nation of cynics.

So Go's hesitation is understandable.

It is not just the hesitation to take an unfamiliar role, it is the realization that people can turn from being rooters to hecklers with little prodding.

The effort that went into the preparation for the event was not exactly for naught.

When he called just before boarding the flight to Cagayan with the President's party, Go left the door partly open for the senate draft that was the purpose of the gathering.

It was just a tiny window, but it was enough to keep the hopes of Go's believers alive.
This was not just another reunion. It might in fact be a precursor of bigger things to come.
