The Gospel of Jesus Christ (March25, 2018-Sunday)  Luke 8:16-18-No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covered it with a vessel, or putted [it] under a bed; but setteth [it] on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. 

For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither [anything] hid, that shall not be known and come abroad: This gospel reminds us to show our goodness as our light to the society.

Make yourself as an instrument to let other people see the beauty of this world. Let them open their eyes because of your examples towards them. Do not keep in secret the stored goodness in your heart because God designed that to show for the benefits of others.
You are here to do something different to make other lives different. Look at a certain candle; it will be consumed little by little but the light benefits the whole place. This is your life; to be consumed for the sake of others. You are like a candle that little by little becomes smaller but a useful dissolution. You will grow old and die but before it will happen, be sure to do more good things because it matters for your salvation. Do not waste your long life in the things that matter nothing for your salvation. Galatians 6:9‚Äù
Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary. Do not stop in doing the right thing because you are born for that purpose. You are born to do something great and prove yourself that your existence is not a mess but a worth living for. 

Prove to God that he made the right decision for allowing you to experience the wonders of this world. Tell God that the purpose of your creation is done because you do his will despite of the imperfections of this earth.
