Binisaya as national language
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

WE ARE NO experts in Binisaya like Dr. Jes Tirol, but during the first few months of the Duterte Administration we texted CabSecEvasco and Chito Fuentes, two Boholanos occupying important positions in the corridors of power with whom we share (or used to?) ideologicalleanings.Our message? It would be great to have the President declare that Cebuano-Binisaya is at least equal to Tagalog (or Filipino?) in stature as national language. We did not get any response. Fine.

Months ago, it was reported that Atty. Leo M. Zaragosa, national president of LUDABI, LubassaDagangBisaya, is pushing for a similar advocacy. To our mind, we got vindicated.
And it is not difficult to see the logic of this advocacy. Almost 2/3 of the country speaks the language. Tourists and social scientists alike who have travelled around our archipelago do attest to that. We hope it gets the President’s nod.

SPIRITUAL PRACTICE FOR THE SUMMER VACATION

This week’s quote comes from Daniel Miessler:  “Accepting life as a pure gift, I am released from the compulsion to see my desires fulfilled. I’m free to practice gratitude for everything that comes my way, to say ‘thy will be done’ in the face of circumstances that run contrary to my expectations. Yet, this life of surrender is not one of mere passive compliance with my fate. I participate in a life of co-creation with the amazing Spirit that restores me and heals the world. I am invited to cooperate with ceaseless wonders and new beginnings”.

Miessler actually offers three spiritual practices. But we focus on this one because this is the least radical. The two others are a bit shocking: Acknowledge that you are going to die and stop trying to win. Our chosen quote is actually the third and last: Accept life as a pure gift. 

Have a meaningful summer vacation, everyone!
