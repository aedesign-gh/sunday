Palm Sunday in our life

Today Catholic Christians will be commemorating the triumphant and royal entry of Jesus, King of the Jews, to Jerusalem “on board” a donkey where He was met by a cheering multitude of people most of whom have witnessed Him perform miracles during the last three (3) years that He taught them the way, the life, and the truth about the Son of God who should be followed in order to inherit the kingdom of heaven. This also ushers in the Holy Week that will end on Easter Sunday with His resurrection from His death on the cross, a death He freely accepted top redeem man from sin.

Although Jesus was riding a donkey, His entry was really one fit for a King because there to meet Him were multitudes of people along the street from the gate of Jerusalem to the plaza cheering and singing hosannas and waving fronds of palms as he passed by them.  Unfortunately these would also be the same people who would later shout “crucify Him!” on Good Friday when Pilate asked them who they would free and who they would condemn to death. 

This scenario of the first Palm Sunday is no different from what we have and see during this age of the modern Church and the modern Christians.  Many Christians profess their devotion to their faith as Catholics or as members of other Christian Sects.  Their speeches before groups and gatherings of people are full of hosannas and alleluias about their faith in God and their loyalty and obedience to His commandments. But when confronted with a choice between their vested interest and those of the public, vested interest always wins.  

To the real believers of Christ, Holy Week is the time to be one with Him in His passion and death on the cross. It means therefore there attendance in liturgies and rituals laid out for the whole week.  It means examining how one has approximated the life that Christ has asked of His followers. It means atoning for one’s sins and transgressions and coming back to God through the sacrament of confession for the Catholics. But how fast many of us modern day Christians have forgotten what we say and profess about our faith.  Holy Week has taken a new slant in our lives.  

Look at what many of us do before and during Holy Week. Preparations no longer consist of planning which church to go to and attend liturgies and rituals, when to go to confession for Catholics, or whether to bring one’s own palaspas or just ask from a neighbour on Palm Sunday and so on.

To many Christians now, Holy Week has become a time and an opportunity to realize that dream of having a grand vacation to a favourite place or beach resort where one can just frolic with family and friends and just enjoy with great abandon.  Holy Week is a time for taking a leave from work without having to wake up early in the morning so as not to be late for work. Holy Week is a whole week of just malling and shopping, of eating outdoors in favourite shops and restaurants.  Holy Week is the time for recovering lost sleep due to late night outing with the barkada hopping from one bar and watering hole to the other almost every night of one’s life.  

In other words, Holy Week to many modern-day Christians is a respite from the daily grind of modern day life.  It is an escape from having to make big decisions in one’s life, work or calling.  It is as easy as saying “crucify Him!” by the Jews when asked whether to free Jesus or crucify Him.  And sadly it is not living what one professes in his life and faith.

It is like saying “No” to become a witness in a case in court that would convict an accused or help the innocent.  It is like passing by an injured person without helping either by calling 119 or 117 for help.  But above all it is saying “I love you Jesus” but not living his commandments.

This is why we see no end to the problems that we now face in society. There is a disconnect or dysfunction between what we say and what we do, between our values and our behaviour.(For comments, email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
