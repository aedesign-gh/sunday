3rdSunday of Lent (cycle B)
Readings:	Ex20:1-17; 1 Cor1:22-25; Jn2:13-25

What we heard in our Gospel this Sunday is somehow scandalous.  We always picture Jesus as gentle and compassionate.  But in our Gospel today he seems to be violent.  The driving of the traders from the temple is related in all four gospels, and this shows the importance the writers attached to this dramatic and violent act of Jesus.  Now let us see why Jesus acted as he did. His anger is a terrifying thing; the picture of Jesus with the whip is an awe-inspiring sight. We must see what moved Jesus to this white-hot anger in the Temple Courts.

What enraged Jesus was that pilgrims to the Passoverwere being exploited at an exorbitant rate by the money-changers. It was a rampant and shameless social injustice--and what was worse, it was being done in the name of religion.

When Jesus said, “Take all this out here and stop using my Father’s house as a market…” he was reminding his listeners of Zechariah’s prophecy: in the time of the Messiah “there will be no more traders in the temple of Yahweh Sabbaoth” (Zech 14:21).  By purifying the temple of “traders”, Jesus declares that the kingdom of the Messiah has begun, and he clearly and forcibly condemns every combination and confusion between religion and economic interests.

This teaching will always apply to the Christian religion.  The history of the Church is full of sins of this type.  Religion was often used to hide or justify interests, advantages and profits that had nothing to do with the Gospel.  The existence of these sins cannot be denied or justified.  It is important and urgent that the Church, as well as individual Christian communities, be always irreproachable on this point.  There should be no tricks, no deception, no self-interest in the use and administration of the goods of the community.

When Jesus said, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up…” he is now no longer speaking of the trade and trade going on in the temple.  He is speaking of a new temple and in fact the evangelist remarks immediately: “He was speaking of the temple that was his body.”

This statement is important.  The Jews were convinced that God lived in the temple of Jerusalem, and that is why they always went there to offer him sacrifices.  They believed that God enjoys the scent of the incense and the blood of the victims.  Jesus now says that this type of belief is over.  God will soon build a new temple where one acceptable sacrifice will be offered.  The new temple is not our churches or chapels made of stone or concrete cement.  The new temple would be something quite different: it would be built “in three days” to be completed on Easter day.  By raising his Son from the dead, the Father has laid the foundation and cornerstone of this new holy place.  On this stone he has laid other living stone: the disciples of Christ.  Together they make up the body of Christ, the new temple where God now lives – Christ and the community of believers.

The fragrance of incense and acceptable sacrifices is continually rising from this holy place.  And what is it?  We must be convinced that our songs, processions and incense add nothing to God’s glory and honor.  The only sacrifices acceptable to him are the works of charity: the generous service to our neighbors, especially the poorest the sick, the weakest, the hungry, the naked, etc.  Every time we bend down in front of a brother or a sister to serve them, the fragrance of our offering rises up to heaven.  With Christ and in Christ we are the temple of God.
