Thank you, Ma’am.
BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

Someone said on radio, “Kung naahan pa pudko di pudkomopaeskwelasaakongmgaanaksa public school”. We respect that personal opinion. That’s the speaker’s choice. But we beg to disagree. The way it was spoken was quite condescending, and I felt sad.

I studied at Dimiao Central Elementary School, and I am proud to say that my teachers were really good. In fact, when I met an accident in Mindanao in the early 70s and was forced to transfer to another school in Davao, I excelled. I owe it to my teachers in Dimiao’s public elementary school. Thank you, Mam. Thank you, Sir.

President Carlos P. Garcia himself was a public school teacher before he became a lawyer and Congressman, then Governor, Senator, Vice President and President. He acquired his primary education in his native town Talibon, then took his secondary education in Cebu Provincial High School, now Abellana National School, both on top of his class. We, Boholanos who are proud of CPG, must not look down on public schools.

If I may point out, public education in the Philippines is already standardized. I can say without fear or favor that the entering salary in public schools are generally much higher than those in private schools. Private schools do have their own standards. But I know for a fact that it is difficult to look for teachers for private schools nowadays because the best graduates in elementary education usually aim for a slot at the local public elementary schools under the Department of Education (DepEd).

And speaking of the Department of Education, my favorite member of the Duterte Cabinet is DepEd Secretary Leonor “Liling” Briones.  She was our country’s National Treasurer during the presidency of Fidel Valdez Ramos. She is a light in the midst of darkness. Here’s what she said about drug abuse: "We, at DepEd consider drug abuse as a health problem. No child will be expelled or shamed because of that problem. Their privacy will be protected. They are victims, not perpetrators. We are working with the Department of Health to help these victims".

This week’s quote comes from Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Austrian philosopher and scientist: “Every education is self-education, and as teachers we can only provide the environment for children’s self-education. We have to provide the most favorable conditions where, through our agency, children can educate themselves according to their own destinies”.
