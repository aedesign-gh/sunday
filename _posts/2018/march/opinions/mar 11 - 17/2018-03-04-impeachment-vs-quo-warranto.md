Impeachment vs. Quo Warranto

In the next few days, we will be hearing a lot about impeachment and quo waranto proceedings especially against Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno of the Supreme Court.

We will try to explain in a layman’s way these two creatures and its possible impact to our own legal and political system.

But as an officer of the court, pardon us if we will not delve into the nitty-gritty of these terminologies vis-à-vis with the lady chief justice even if she is on leave, whether it its “wellness” or “forced” as reports will try to indicate.

Impeachment is a process of removing top national officials like the President, Vice-President, the members of the Supreme Court, members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman.

Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provided the grounds for impeachment. They are culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes or betrayal of public trust. 

The impeachment complaint must be filed in the House of Representatives and supported by at least one member in the Lower House. 

In the case of Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno, the impeachment complaint was filed by Atty. Lorenzo Gadon and endorsed by several congressmen including Cong. Gwen Garcia of Cebu.

Once endorsed, the House committee on justice will decided whether the complaint is sufficient in form and in substance. In the case of Sereno, the Lower House voted in the affirmative during the plenary session.

The House committee on justice is expected to wrap up its deliberation within the first week of March and send the same for plenary deliberation together with its recommendation.

If the committee report is approved, an Article of Impeachment will then be created and will be endorsed to the Senate for the impeachment trial.

The Senators, acting as jurors, will deliberate the matter and decide whether to impeach Sereno or not.

Now, here is a short cut of the entire process. Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a Petition for Quo Warranto against Sereno right before the Supreme Court questioning the validity of her appointment as chief justice.

Under Rule 66 of the Revised Rules of Court, a quo warranto proceeding is an action by the government against individuals.

Section 3 of Rule 66 provides that the Solicitor General or a public prosecutor, when directed by the President of the Philippines, or when upon complaint or otherwise he has good reason to believe that any case specified in the preceding section can be established by proof, must commence such action.

In other words, a quo warranto is a special form of legal action used to resolve a dispute over whether a specific person has the legal right to hold the public office that he or she occupies.Quo warranto is used to test a person’s legal right to hold an office, not to evaluate the person’s performance in the office. 

For example, in Sereno’s case, a quo warranto action may be brought to determine whether she satisfied a requirement that she met the requirements for the position of Chief Justice like submitting
