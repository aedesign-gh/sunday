The Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (CVRAA) meet at the CPG Sports Complex started last Saturday. There were 4 provinces and 15 cities competing the different sport events to a total of 19 delegations. The provinces are Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental and Siquijor while the cities are Tagbilaran City, Cebu City,  Danao City, Naga City, Lapu-Lapu City, Mandaue City, Talisay City, Carcar City, Bogo City, Toledo City, Dumaguete City, Guihulngan City, Bais City, Bayawan City and Tanjay City.  The more, the merrier.

Athletic meets in the olden times were such a prestigious activities comparable to beauty pageants that people of all ages looked up to. They were big events that hostprovinces had no classes so pupils and teachers can witness the competitions.

In the 60’s there was no CVRAA at that time. It was EVAA or the East Visayas Athletic Association meet because it was only the provinces of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol and Negros Oriental vying for provincial prestige and supremacy.When Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos created the Central Visayas region thus the CVRAA was born. It was only in the capital cities of these four provinces the sports competition revolved. Nowadays participating cities also host the sports competition thus the competition will come back to that place 19 years later. 

The province of Cebu was the one to reckon with during CVRAAs.  Her topnotch athletes came from universities which give scholarships to exemplary players of their field scouted from all over the country. These athletes who went to national games to represent CVRAA garner gold medals. The glitter of Cebu dimmed when Surigao province pirated her athletes for the athletic camp of then Gov. Segio Sering. 

In the 70’sprivate high schools, colleges and universities formed their own athletic meet which is the PRISAA. The best athletes in the region came now from the PRISAA. Public schools lost their talented athletes to PRISAA. To regain lost glory of public schools they turned their eyes and banked on to the elementary pupils. 

The CPG Sports Complex was constructed in 1958 for the Philippine National Interscholastic Meet. Its creation had closed a portion of then Rafael Palma St. now Ma. Clara St. which separated the campuses of the then Bohol High School now the Dr. Cecilio Putong National High School and the then Bohol School of Arts and Trades now the Bohol Island State University. The CPG Sports Complex saw her second national games since 1958 when the PRISAA national games were held here last 1971. Her third will be on April this year. 

Then cities began to field their own athletes in the early 2nd century. They separated from their own mother provinces. The cities added the number of contingents participating in the regional meet. 

Though the number of contingents had increased, and more events have to be competed inlike sepak takraw, taekwando, boxing, triathlon,  gymnastics, singing and dance and beauty contestare in the sportsfest, it had lost its come on. During the competition there are only a handful of spectators in the grandstand. In the olden days the CPG Sports Complex was  jammed pack to capacity. A brass band was on standby that if a crack of a starting pistol was heard of a running event, it sent playing a marching song to reinforce the thrill of the spectators.

These days, during athletic meets classes go on. No more spectators to witness the activities except the players themselves and their coaches. Gone are the glory days of athletic meets. Breaking an athletic record is no longer a big deal and no one talks about it anymore, unlike the old days.

Classes of city schools had already been suspended as early as Monday to billet visiting delegations, but classes in the entire province will go on during the CVRAA meet. The public school teachers are given only one day of their choice to see the athletic meet at CPG Sports Complex.
