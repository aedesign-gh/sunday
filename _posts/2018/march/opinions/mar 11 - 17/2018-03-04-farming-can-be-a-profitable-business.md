Farming can be a profitable business

Last week I joined Mr. Lionel Mendoza, an economist hired by the Asian Development Bank to do scoping studies for our Livelihood Enhancement Support component of the Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project (INREMP) being implemented by DENR through the people’s organizations (POs) and municipal local government units (MLGUs) in the Wahig-Inabanga River Basin. The activities will identify the top five crops being produced by the PO members and the status of these crops in the market.  The scoping activities for a month will identify the commodities with strong market demand and good market growth potentials and what are those that exhibit strong competitive advantage.  

The initial results were not surprising. Occupying the top commodities are rice, corn, coconut and fishing. But it is somehow surprising because even for those living in upland areas that are hilly and mountainous, they still listed rice as their top farm produce.  None, at least for the first week of scoping activity, have listed high value crops like cacao, coffee and vegetables like lettuce, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli.  

To a Boholano, this information is no longer surprising because the Boholano farmers have always been used to planting rice, corn and coconut even in places where they are not suited for higher production. The Boholano farmer is already contented with just producing for the consumption of the family and never for earning additional income by selling in the market the extra produce.

It is high time we change this traditional mind-sets of the Boholano farmer or all farmers for that matter. Farmers need only to be organized and guided on the crops or commodities that are in demand and command higher prices in the market.  They should now think like businessmen because farming can also be a business.  They have to be taught to be entrepreneurial starting with their choices of crops or commodities to produce.

Let’s get the example of cacao. Wet cacao beans now is bought by traders at P150 per kilo. The farmers could add value to the beans by drying it so that it will now command a price of from P170-P200 per kilo.  The price even gets higher if the farmerknows how to ferment it which can be easily learned from trained “cacao doctors” who are now available in the province.

Yet cacao remains a largely imported commodity in Bohol.  Ms.DalareichPolot, CEO of the Dalareich Chocolate House that produces the best tableya and the Ginto chocolate bars in Bohol, says that they can only source 300 kilos of cacao seeds from Bohol farmers out of their need of 1,000 kilos every month.  The 700 kilos have to be ordered from Davao.

Kennemer that raise cacao seedlings and also buy cacao beans in Carmen has sold out more than 500,000 (I may be corrected on this) seedlings since it opened some years ago with a promise to buy the produce but as of last month it could only show a record of 500 kilos that trickle in every month.  So now it is closing its nursery operation although it will continue to buy cacao beans from the farmers.

In my travels to the countryside where INREMP is being implemented, I saw hundreds of grown up cacao trees, meaning big enough to bear fruit, but they are not bearing fruits.  Those that I saw with fruits either exhibit lack of cultural management or infested with borers.

It is time we train government technicians who can cater to crops other than rice, corn and coconut.  In other words technicians who can also help our farmers with their problems on raising high value crops.  We need technicians who can handhold and guide our farmers to venture into other crops that demand higher prices in the market so that farmers can be encouraged to produce not just for their consumption but also for additional income.

Our concerned government agencies should now adopt programs to meet rural communities’ challenges and improve smallholder’s livelihoods.  These should be programs that focus on designing, implementing and monitoring of sustainable integrated agricultural & production systems combined with other sustainable rural development programs.

This is the time for government agencies to work together as one and consider only one client and not diversified clients.  That is the principle of inclusiveness.

And it better be soon before we ran out of farmers.  Right now our average age of the farmer in Bohol is 58 years old.  The young who go to school and get educated do not want to go back to the farm because to be a farmer is to be poor which is not correct because farming can also be a profitable business.(For comments, please email to: coolrst47@gmail.com)
