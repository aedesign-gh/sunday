The Gospel of Jesus Christ (March 4, 2018-Sunday) Matthew 5:38-42-Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away: In our gospel for today, Jesus taught us to give our maximum tolerance to those who hurt us, physically and emotionally because this is the paradigm of a great love.

In Matthew 5:44-but I say unto you, “Love your enemies,” “bless them that curse you,” “do good to them that hate you,” and “pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.” Take note, your enemy is just possessed by Satan your real enemy. Hate Satan but love the victim human. 

The Jewish church never taught love that’s why Jesus founded his church to propagate love to everyone. Mother Theresa said; “The true scarcity on this earth is not from foods and material things but love”. 

Only few people bear this real love to anyone. Do the right thing for the sake of others is the proof of your love within. Giving forgiveness to any violator is a very wonderful antidote to make this person realize about his mistakes. 

Take note, if you know how to forgive, the benefit is not for the person only you have forgiven but the beneficiary is yours. Healing will take place once you know how to forgive. Miracles will come in your way if you know how to forgive. Favors of the living God will be yours once you know how to let go the damage has been done in your life.
