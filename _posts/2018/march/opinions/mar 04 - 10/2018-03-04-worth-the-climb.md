2ndSunday of Lent (cycle B)
Readings:	Gen22:1-2, 9a, 10-13, 15-18; Rom8:31b-34; Mk9:2-10

We have our share of experiences about climbing high places: a tree, a building, or a mountain.  It has become a practice for some to climb on a mountain during Holy Week.  One thing we share in common is that we all experience the difficulty in climbing.  It takes a lot of effort and energy.  But once we are on top, we see the beautiful view of the surroundings and that of below and we say it was worth the climb.

The mountain is very symbolic in the Bible.  It stands for the place where God manifests Himself.  It is a place of encounter with God.  We can read some passages in the Bible where a significant character encounters God on a mountain.  The accounts we heard in our readings this Sunday happened on a mountain.  In the first reading we heard of Abraham’s encounter with God on the mountain of Moriah when he was about to sacrifice his only son Isaac.  In the Gospel, we heard of the encounter of the apostles Peter, James, and John with God in the transfiguration of Jesus on mount Tabor or Hermon.

It was on a mountain when God tested the faith of Abraham when he was about to sacrifice his only son Isaac.  It was on a mountain when Jesus showed His glory of transfiguration.  It was on a mountain when God sacrificed his only son Jesus.  It was on a mountain when the Lord ascended back to the Father.

As to our Gospel on Mark’s version of the transfiguration of the Lord, this was for the apostle a special sign of Jesus’ glory.  It did something very precious for the disciples.

Before they went up to the mountain they had been shattered by Jesus' statement that he was going to Jerusalem to die. That seemed to them the complete negation of all that they understood of the Messiah. They were still bewildered and uncomprehending. Things were happening which not only baffled their minds but were also breaking their hearts. What they saw on the mountain of the transfiguration would give them something to hold on to, even when they could not understand. Cross or no Cross, they had heard God's voice acknowledge Jesus as his Son.

It made them, in a special sense, witnesses of the glory of Christ. A witness has been defined as a man who first sees and then shows. This time on the mountain had shown them the glory of Christ, and now they had the story of this glory to hide in their hearts and to tell to men, not at the moment, but when the time came.

Nonetheless, they still have to climb up before they experience this glory of the transfiguration (in the case of the apostles) and salvation (in the case of Abraham).  And climbing up is not easy.

Sometimes in life, we experience that we are climbing up on a high mountain.  The difficulties, challenges, problems, sufferings, and the like are steep slopes that we have to pass.  But once we reach on top, we will start to appreciate the beautiful view around and below us.  If we feel like having difficulty moving up in this life it is because God wants us to have a better view on life.  Then it is only after appreciating the beauty of life after not giving up on its problems that we can say, “It was worth the climb.”
