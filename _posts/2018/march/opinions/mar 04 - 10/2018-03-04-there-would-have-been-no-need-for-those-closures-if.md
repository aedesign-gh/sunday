It is very unfortunate that many times we have a reactive government.  That is usually the result when there is a disconnect between policy and enforcement.  We have more than adequate policies and laws but enforcement is wanting.  Policy and enforcement are like husband and wife.  One has no essence without the other.  The same is true with plan and budget.  We may have the plan but if its implementation is not supported with budget, it remains a useless piece of document. 

Last week the tourism industry players were jittery when President Duterte announced that he would order the closure of several tourism establishments in Boracay Island for violation of environmental laws especially as far as solid and liquid waste management is concerned. He also promised to charge government officials for negligence. Indeed there were already reports during the week just ended already that some establishments were ordered padlocked by the Department of Environment and natural Resources (DENR).

When government threatens to use its fangs against erring establishments, that is the only time when those bound by the law to follow would pause and look back at their operations whether they were compliant with the terms of their permits and licenses to operate.  We saw this in Panglao Island last week when no less than NEDA Secretary and Director General Ernesto Pernia also announced the possible closure of some tourism establishments and resorts in PanglaoIsland for violations of environmental laws.

Actually the situation could not have reached this point if there was regular monitoring by the local government units (LGUs) of compliance by the establishments with environmental requirements and provided the right environment or mechanism to comply.  Given the amount of investment that businessmen spend in order to operate a business, no businessman in his right mind would deliberately violate environmental laws knowing that this could result in the closure or stoppage of his business.

Government, in this case the LGU,has the obligation to provide the facilities needed for business establishments to comply with the provisions of the law like those in waste disposal and management.  But in this case, the Municipal Government of Panglao was not equal to its share of the responsibility.

For a fast growing town like Panglao, the local government has underestimated the pace of development and therefore failed to provide the kind of facilities that are needed to be installed in support of investments that are coming in.  The local government of Panglao would have known that the operation of big hotels and resorts would generate increased solid waste, yet until lately, it has only two garbage trucks that are not enough to collect tons and tons of solid waste generated just be the resorts.  No matter how households, and business establishments would segregate their solid waste if these are not collected on time would always result in garbage disposal problem. Barangay governments have also been tasked to collect garbage but without the equipment and facility, the same problem will just be compounded.

Waste segregation can be forced on households and business establishment but without an efficient collection system by local governments, solid waste disposal will still be a problem.  That is why establishments pay environmental fees so that the LGUs could implement an efficient garbage disposal.

Government cannot force establishments to put up their own sanitary landfill facilities because that is the function of government.

On the issue of high coliform content of the sea waters of Panglao, this cannot be attributed to big establishments because before they were issued permits to operate or construct, one of the requirements to be submitted is the installation of the sewerage treatment plant (STP).  I know this because I used to chair the Review and Development Committee of the Panglao Island Tourism Development. Once construction of the building is completed, no operation and occupancy permit can be issuedunlessthese STPs are first inspected and found operational.

What needs to be regularly inspected now are those households and business establishments that are not required STPs to build and operate but only three-chambered septic tanks. There are thousands of them along the coastal areas of Panglao Island.

In other words, let government be proactive and anticipate what needs to be done to address the challenges of good governance.
