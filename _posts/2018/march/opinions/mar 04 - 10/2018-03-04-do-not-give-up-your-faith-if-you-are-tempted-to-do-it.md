The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Feb. 25, 2018-Sunday) Mark 10:28-31”Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

2 Timothy 4:6-8”For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good “fight,” I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 

Can you die for God’s glory? Take note, martyrdom is the shortest way to heaven. Your attitude is tested if you will choose God or to deny him in times of pressures. You need to love him more than anything else. You need to prioritize God because he will care everything for your favors. 

Matthew 6:33"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Allow yourself to be in the hands of the living God. Do not give up your faith if you are tempted to do it because of the negative circumstances that you are in.
