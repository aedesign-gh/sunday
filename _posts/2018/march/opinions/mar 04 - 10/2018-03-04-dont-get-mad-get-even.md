Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme, in one of his hit movies in 1995, “Sudden Death”, paraphrased a line believed to have come from Irish-born American politician, Joseph P. Kennedy, father of John F. Kennedy, by saying professionals don’t get angry, we just get even.

In short, the line is to the effect that don’t get mad, just get even.So if someone harms you, you should not waste your energy on being angry, but concentrate on harming the person in return.
Since our college days, we adopted this principle of retaliation and revenge. In our law days, our professors told us that we can kill a cow in different ways.

Thus, we need not use our hand and armoury in order to inflict wounds against an enemy. One can inflict injuries not necessarily physical in nature but it could be against one’s emotions, feelings and mind.

Take for example this sonnamagun who has been pestering us since we devoted our time on the fourth estate from politics.

If Pres. Duterte has a PiaRanada of Rappler, we have one too in the local scene. But in Duterte’s case, the criticism of Ranada is within the media reports she is writing online. In our case, the harassment has gone low to personal level.

When accepted the challenge to write starting last month for the Manila Bulletin, the nation’s leading newspaper since 1900, this sonnamagun cannot accept the fact that we are once again in the national level.

But writing for a national daily is something not new to us. We have been writing in the Manila Times in the early 1990’s but we stopped as we concentrated on our law studies.

The sonnamagun has the temerity and the gall to write to our editors in the Manila Bulletin complaining among others why they allow us to write when we do not personally attend press conferences. 

This is bullsh*t. As an editor-publisher, we need not personally go to press conferences or cover media affairs as we have our staff who can represent our outfit.

The complaint reached us as relayed by our Visayas bureau chief, Minerva BC Newman, who simply set aside the allegations against us and merely laughed out loud.

Well, the sonnamagun is not after the honorarium that we are getting from the Manila Bulletin as it only covered a single notarization of a legal document.Apparently, the reason behind the complaint is professional jealousy.

This sonnamagun and the clique he or she represented has been in the opposite fence when we have our interview with ABS-CBN last year, when we come up with a story attacking a report implicating the city fiscal’s office, when we won a bidding for the publication of an ordinance and so on and so forth.

We cannot help but came out plans on how to retaliate and crush their necks. But we are always reminded of the saying that we should not get mad. As Jean-Calude Van Damme would like to say, we are professionals and we do not get angry, just get even.

The same feeling we had while we were in the world of politics until we re-joined the media practice against a local mediaman who has been a critic and a paid attacker in everything that we did.

We did not lift our finger against him. We have been the target of his radio commentaries and in his Facebook account. But we did not go down to his level knowing that he is a mere electrician.

One day, he was rushed to the hospital and died after weeks of confinement.
