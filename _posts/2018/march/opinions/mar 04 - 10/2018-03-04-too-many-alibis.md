When the answer is too long or too complicated to be understood, either the answer is not truthful or it is not an answer at all, but merely an alibi.

Representatives from the Department of Energy once attended a session of the SangguniangPanlalawigan (SP) to answer the first question. Their answers occupied six pages of long bond paper in our SP Journal. But SP Member Tommy Abapo summarized it in one sentence – DOE representatives are saying that gasoline prices here are higher because there are only two oil depots. They had other technical answers. But they boiled down to the lack of storage. They were probably trying their best to give lengthy replies. But frankly, I am not convinced.

According to wikihow.com, “Too many details may tip you off to the person's desperation to get you to believe what is being said”. Besides, when replies to certain questions are obviously premeditated and too broad, it might give the impression that there had been well-prepared efforts to hide the truth. We are not accusing anyone of any wrongdoing. We are just simply not satisfied. That’s all there is to it.

This week’s quote comes from Dr. Walden Bello of Princeton University:  “Many of those advocating a Revolutionary Government in the Philippines are frustrated middle class supporters, political adventurers, ex-military rebels, and ex-activists who want to have a larger share of the political and economic power that they feel is now monopolized by what they view as the “oligarchs” that have “hijacked” Duterte. These people do not seek system change; they simply want a share of the spoils. But in contrast to the elites allied with Duterte, they are conscious of the dangers of Duterte’s slipping popularity among the masses that voted for him owing to his failure so far to deliver concrete measures that would make a difference in their lives. However, the absence of a program of social and economic reform in the RevGov agenda shows that its partisans have no answer to people’s aspirations other than the advocacy of an authoritarian order”.
