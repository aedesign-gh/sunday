For five years in a row, the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI), an annual ranking of Philippine cities and municipalities developed by the National Competitiveness Council, recently ranked Tagbilaran City as one of the best in the country.

CMCI is ranking the competitiveness of LGUs based on the three main pillars of governance -- economic dynamism, government efficiency and infrastructure. The higher the score of a city or municipality, the more competitive it is. 

This year, Tagbilaran City was ranked as the 8th most competitive out of 112 Component Cities in the Philippines; 6th in Government Efficiency; 9th in Economic Dynamism; 9th in Infrastructure, and the 12th Most Improved LGU in the country.

City Mayor John Geesnell "Baba" Yap is ever grateful to all the people behind the City's success.

This would not be possible without the efforts of the men and women in the City Government, both the elected officials, employees and personnel. With the able guidance of USAID-SURGE, through its coordinator, Maam Linda Paredes and City DILG Redemcion Cag-ong, all our efforts paid off. This recognition only proves our commitment to enhance our public service to the Tagbilaranons Yap emphasized. 

He also cited the invaluable support of the provincial government and the external stakeholders of the city. 

Tagbilaran Citys competitiveness was ranked 28th in 2014, it went down to 34th in 2015, then improved its standing again in 2016 by placing 25th, in 2017, Tagbilaran City climbed 4 notches higher by landing in 21st place. 

This year proved to be special as Tagbilaran City landed in 8th place out of the 112 component cities in the Philippines. 

It also improved its rankings in the three different pillars, 6th in Government Efficiency, 9th in Economic Dynamism, 9th in Infrastructure, and ranked 12th as one of the most improved LGU in the country.
