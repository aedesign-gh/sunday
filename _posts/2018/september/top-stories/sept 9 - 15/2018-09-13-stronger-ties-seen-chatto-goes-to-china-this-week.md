A stronger partnership that can draw to Bohol fresh investments and more tourists is to be pursued on Gov. Edgar Chatto visit to two important provinces in China this week.

The Chinese consulate will open talks on development and institutional exchanges in the provinces of Sichuan and Jiangxi tomorrow.

Jiangxi already has a sisterhood pact with Bohol, though.

Chatto will meet with his Sichuan counterpart and discuss with some businessmen, potential investors and tourism stakeholders about a mutual interest of a direct flight to Bohol.

The Department of Transportation (DOTr)  has expected the new Bohol Panglao international airport to open in October this year.  

Sichuan just convened in its capital, Chengdu, its 4th China International Investment Conference.

It was the Chinese province's largest, most authoritative and most content-rich event of its kind since 2015.

The conference invited executives and representatives from over 170 leading institutions, both in and beyond China.

Among them were the World Tourism Union, Pacific Asia Travel Association, China Enterprises Investment Association, US-China Association for Promotion of Economy and Trade, and Pei's P&D Inc.
