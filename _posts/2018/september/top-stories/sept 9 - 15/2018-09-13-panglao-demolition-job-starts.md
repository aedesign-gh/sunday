PANGLAO.– Dr. DoloreichDumaluan, a resort owner, said that demolition of illegal structures breaching beach’s 20-meter easement zones in this premier tourist town will start as soon as possible.
 
He said Mayor Pedro Fuertes is set to demolish a certain resort along Alona beach stretch though he did not name it.
 
He said in interview with media on Friday that the mayor is not lukewarm in implementing the law on easement of 20-meter public access zone. “It’s not true that he’s against the government environment preservation program”
 
Dumaluan, who batted for rehabilitation of diminishing sand deposits on coastal areas here, said the mayor wanted a “win-win” solution to the situation in the name of the environment and benefits of the stakeholders and locality.
 
Another approach to address the problem of 20-m encroachment is to listen to the stakeholders thru consultation. The mayor should not only listen to Mike Dino, presidential assistant for the Visayas, or to the governor or DENR, but consult the stakeholders.
 
To prove his point, Dumaluan said, Mayor Fuertes has prepared a demolition order for those who violated the 20-m easement contrary to reports that latter did not do something on the said problem.
 
Mayor Fuertes, in his order for the demolition, urged the stakeholders concerned (those whose structures breach the 20-m easement) to exercise prudence and their avowed corporate social responsibility (CSR) by voluntarily demolish their structures for they are the beneficiaries of the preservation of the environment.
 
Failure to do such, a team composed of this town and provincial government and other agencies will be the one to do it and any expenses incurred in demolition will be charged to them (resort owners).
 
The resort owners violating the 20-m easement were given only until July 31, 2018.
 
A resort manager expressed fear that this premier tourist town could be shut down just like Boracay because of a cesspool if non-compliance of the 20-meter coastal easement continues.
 
 Bellevue Resort manager Rommel Gonzales answered when asked about the closure, “Yes, if DU30 declares it for non-compliance of easement law.”
 
Report quoted Gonzales as saying that he preferred to have the demolition of structure encroaching the 20-m access zone be done first prior to rehabilitation.
 
“I don’t think so. His fear is the fear of the unknown. Let’s find a better a solution,” Dumaluan said.
 
Dumaluan has proposed to the rehabilitation by way of what he called “Engineering intervention. Di pasagdankaygub-on nasa nature,” citing what happened to Japan recently.
 
The plan includes sucking the sand deposits from the sea, citing what Astoria resort in Bacalayon has done as an example. “There are deposits that would probably last for 100 years. The benefit outweighs the environmental destruction which is minimal,” he said.
 
Earlier, an initial 87 beach resorts dotting 11.5% or 5.5 kms. of 40+ kilometers stretch of coastline in this island of less than 10,000 hectares have already been identified and found to have violated the prohibited 20-meter salvage zone..
 
The Environmental Management Bureau (EMB), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) region office have recently conducted an assessment and demarcation of 20-meter zone from the highest tide to the nearest structure of a resort. As it turned out some 87 resorts breached the salvage zone intended by law for public access.
 
DENR vowed to assess more of the rest of the island and someday in other towns, including Anda, which is now becoming a tourist destination.
 
Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu, who conducted ocular inspection of Alona stretch sometime in March, directed regional director William Cuñado of the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DER) region office, “to clean” this town of violations to 20-meter public access zone.
 
Cimatu told Cunado to send notices of violation to all those resorts owners whose buildings already encroached the salvage zone here and to make report to him.
 
He told officials here, Mayor Pedro Fuertes and Vice-Mayor Briccio Velasco, who accompanied him, that it’s good that resort owners whose structures intrude the salvage zone “accepted the fact” that their structures violated the easement area of 20 meters measured from the highest tide of coast line.
 
In separate interview with media, NEDA director-general Ernesto Pernia, a Boholano, who also accompanied Cimatu, said that the intrusion of 20-metere access zone is due to lack of strict enforcement.
 
He said that the local government units concerned should have “to enforce the law vigorously” and failure on their part they should be held liable.
 
“The government is very serious,” apparently in the protection and conservation of the natural resources, he told media.
 
The inspection of the coastline of salvage zone violation came following the waste water of Boracay erupted.
 
Both Cimatu and Pernia said separately that if ever Boracay closure is enforced it would be a gain for Panglao, which also face threat of high water contamination.
 
He said that his mission here is already completed and told Mayor Fuertes “to keep it up” referring to enforce the law for this island, considered as the jewel of Bohol not only because of its white sand beaches but also other come-ons like world renowned dive sites.
 
This town and resort owners were given six months of implementing the law on 20-, access zone. Article 51 of PD 1067 provides, thus.“The banks of rivers and streams and the shores of the seas and lakes throughout their entire length and within a zone of three (3) meters in urban areas, twenty (20) meters in agricultural areas and forty (40) meters in forest areas, along their margins are subject to the easement of public use in the interest of recreation, navigation, floatage, fishing and salvage. No person shall be allowed to stay in this zone longer than what is necessary for recreation, navigation, floatage, fishing or salvage or to build structures of any kind.” (rvo)
