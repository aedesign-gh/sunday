BoniQuirog, Ph.D.

WOMEN’S MONTH IS celebrated in the month of March. But I feel compelled to make this tribute because of what is happening at the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia.

As of this writing, the Philippines garnered 18 medals (4 golds, 1 silver and 13 bronzes) and is ranked 17th. But the amazing thing about this is that, out of the 18 medals our athletes reaped, 13 were won by our female athletes, and only 5 by males. 
On top of that, all the four (4) gold medals were won by Filipina athletes, namely, Hidilyn Diaz for weightlifting, Yuka Saso for women’s individual golf, Yuka, Bianca Pagdanganan, and Lois Kaye Go for women’s team golf, and MargielynDidal for skateboarding.

I saw the performances of Hidilyn Diaz and MargielynDidal on television and found it really astonishing. The good-looking Airforce Sergeant Diaz who won the silver medal in the 2016 Olympics showed how hardwork and dedication can lead to victory despite her admission that government support is really wanting. The humble Cebuana, MargielynDidal, displayed her flawless skateboarding skills which was seen as way above that of her competitors.

Outstanding Boholana Tessa R. Salazar of the Philippine Daily Inquirer said this half-jokingly: “After the men, women rule the world”. Another outstanding Boholana, Marjorie Evasco, Doctor of Literature and National Book Awardee, could not agree more. She said this, quoting Mary Daly, “There is nothing like the sound of women really laughing. The roaring laughter of women is like the roaring of the eternal sea”.

I am mighty proud of Filipina athletes. I can also say without fear or favor that Cory Aquino showed the world how an unassuming wife can lead a nation towards democracy by defeating the Marcos dictatorship and surviving 6 coup attempts against her administration. Although I am not a fan of Gloria Arroyo, I admire her tenacity in standing her ground against death penalty. And if LeniRobredo becomes our country’s 3rd Woman President, it would be God’s will for real change. So mote it be.
