The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Sept. 2, 2018-Sunday) Luke 16:1-8- And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

This gospel reminds us of our honesty in everything that we have possessed. The truth is there are many people who are dishonest in giving times, treasures and talents to God the giver. Take note, the best offering that we can do is to give our lives to God totally. Being steward means making everything entrusted by God to us productive and more fruitful. You are accountable to the things that are attached to you once no one is benefited. God entrusted many things to you because he trusts you so much that you can be a blessing to others.
