As early as these days the air now smells of politics and election as the filing of candidacy on October for next year’s election is getting near.

Along the national highway around Bohol are large format posters and stickers pasted on electric posts and vacant spaces which reads: Sa 2019 WANTED TINOUD NGA BOL-ANON. The question sends the reader to search his mind of what is the characteristic and the traits of a true blue blooded and real Boholano.

The gay community in Bohol had an answer to the question. They said it is a man who makes love to a woman and then lie prone for the love of another man. They called this type of man as talented child.

The first time the posters appeared on the streets, people thought it was just like any other search, the like of “The Model Family”, “The Search of the Father of the Year”, or the “Search of Ginoong Filipinas”.

But as one looks deeper at the posters, there is a hint of politics behind it. It is a political poster aimed at the candidacy of Cong. Art Yap who is eyeing the gubernatorial seat next year to replace Gov. Chatto whose third term of office will come to an end next year.

To recall, Cong. Yap of the third district of the province in not a Boholano who arrived here some nine years ago and ran for congressman and won. He was known to buy out his probable rivals on the congressional seat reasons he run an opposed. And now he will be running for governor.

Cong. Yap is a true bloodied Manila Boy, having born and raised in Manila. He studied law at Ateneo where his teacher was former Pres. Gloria M. Arroyo who appointed him to head in some of her offices and lastly as her Secretary of Agriculture where he figured in some alleged anomalous transactions.  It was the time of Pres. Arroyo when he came to Bohol to run for congress claiming he has roots here and his wife named Carol Gow is from Loboc (kuno).

The stickers and posters are the death knell to the candidacy of Cong. Yap. They are the proverbial nails to his coffin. Boholanos are a partisan lot and parochial. They do not want to be headed by a non-Boholano which it is an affront to the Boholano sensibilities.

Who is the person or persons or political party behind the stickers? The answer to the question is still at the limbo. They must have money to burn.
