We see the forthcoming enthronement of our friend and kumpadre, Johnny Orioque, (on leave) editor-publisher of the Bohol Balita Daily News (BBDN) rising into power in Trinidad town.

If ever Cong. Aris C. Aumentado decides to run for governor in tandem with former Vice Gov, Julius Herrera next year, there is a big possibility that Mayor Baby Cajes of Trinidad will seek the vacant post of congressman in the second district.
We feel that former Cong. OndoyCajes will no longer try seeking his old post due to age and health reasons. He will push the incumbent Trinidad mayor to seek the congressional post in the second district.

Our discussion in this corner will not include the possibility of having VanvanAumentado, wife of the second district solon, to replace her husband and run for congresswoman.

At any rate, if ever Mayor Baby Cajes runs as congresswoman of the second district, speculations are high that Orioque is favored to run for mayor in Trinidad and he indeed is considering his coming to town.

Orioque is the incumbent punong barangay of Poblacion, Trinidad and may run for town mayor without losing his post as mandated by law. Just like in the case of an incumbent senator who runs as a presidential candidate without losing his seat in the senate.

Pardon us to be quite excited during a lightning reunion of the original F4 (not the Meteor Garden, though we have our own San Chai) last Friday evening.
The original Kinampay boys met for more than two hours at the residence of our former Kinampay publisher, NenengCorales, in Dao district despite a hectic schedule.
The former editor-in-chief, former new editor, former managing editor and former staff member were all present.

Chito Fuentes, your truly, Ric V. Obdencio and Kid Caneda, all members of the defunct AngKinampay News (AKN) clandestinely met, so to speak, and recalled some hilarious and nostalgic moments.

The three AKN editors are now publishers by their own right. Fuentes is now the publisher of the coffee book of Pres. Duterte, yours truly is the editor-publisher of this paper and Ric V. Obedencio is now the editor-in-chief of Bohol News Today.
Caneda is the former Presidential Assistant for Regional Concerns (PARECO) in Mindanao during the term of Pres. Erap Estrada and became the administrator of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA).

Well, Caneda may have some hidden agenda in our short “plenum” as he introduced to us a new party-list called National Movement for Federalism (NAMFED) led by Gen. Danny Lim who now chairs the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA).

Lim will be the first nominee of the party list. The second nominee will be the financier of the party list but has planned to run as a full time congressman while the third nominee is still vacant.

We do not have any second thoughts in deciding to support the party list introduced by Caneda but under one condition: that he will be one of the nominees. He now feels that he is now a new kid in town.
