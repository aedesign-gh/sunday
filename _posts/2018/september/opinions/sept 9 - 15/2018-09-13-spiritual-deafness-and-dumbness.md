23rd Sunday of the Year (cycle B)
Readings	Is 35:4-7; Jas 2:1-5; Mk 7:31-37

This Sunday’s Gospel tells us a very wonderful story of one of the healing miracles of Jesus.  He healed a man who was deaf and who had an impediment in his speech.  We all share our experience with deaf-mute persons.  I personally like to hang out at a known café here in TagbilaranCity where most of the employees are deaf-mute.  I pity them and nevertheless I also appreciate them for their diligence.

There are reasons for a man’s incapacity to speak.  One perhaps is the underdevelopment of one’s speech organs.  Another reason is not about the problem on the speech organs but a problem on the sense of hearing.  A person may have a well-developed speech organ but somehow his incapacity to hear makes him incapable of speaking.  The latter, often called deaf-mute, is the one that Jesus healed in our Gospel.

If we put ourselves in their shoes, we’ll find out that it’s not easy being deaf and dumb.  Being deaf is somehow embarrassing.  In some ways it is more embarrassing to be deaf than to be blind.  Most of us think that blindness is worse than deafness.  But Helen Keller, who was blind and deaf, considered deafness the far greater handicap.  A deaf person knows he cannot hear; and when someone in a crowd shouts at him and tries to make him hear; in his excitement he becomes all the more helpless.  Such a person is incapable of communicating with others, of keeping in contact with others: he cannot hear what they say, cannot react… since he has not heard a thing.  When you can’t hear, a lot of doors in the normal world slam shut.  Turning the radio is pointless.  Watching television is bland and often boring.  Conversing with someone is next to impossible.  After a while you feel lonely and abandoned.  Deaf persons live in isolation, alone.

William Barclay wrote a prayer on deaf persons and a portion of it goes: “O God, the trouble about being deaf is that most people find deaf folks a nuisance.  They sympathize with people who are blind and lame, but they get irritated and annoyed with people who are deaf.  And the result of this is that deaf people are apt to avoid company, and get more and more shut in.”

At the time of Jesus every illness was considered a punishment from God, but deafness was also seen a curse because it prevented one from hearing the word of the Lord proclaimed in the synagogues.

The story of the deaf person gives us a better appreciation of this Sunday’s Gospel.  It gives us an insight into how the deaf and dumb man felt after Jesus healed him.  For the first time in his life, he felt a part of life.

The healing of the deaf and dumb man in our Gospel tells us many things.  It tells us that Jesus is the Messiah, the fulfillment of the promise that we heard in the First Reading.  Prophet Isaiah says, “The deaf will hear… and those who cannot speak will shout for joy.”

It also tells us something personal about Jesus.  That Jesus is a compassionate person.  He took the man aside from the crowd, all by himself.  Here is the most tender considerateness.  Deaf people are often embarrassed by their situation.  They can’t understand the simplest questions people ask them.  The feel different and out of place.  By taking the man away from the crowd, Jesus shows real compassion for him.  He shows real sensitivity to his situation.

It also tells us something deeper.  In the Gospel of Mark, this deaf and dumb person stands for all those whose ears are shut; they cannot listen to the Gospel of Christ and cannot praise the Lord with their mouths.  St. Paul said that humans do not acquire their faith through visions or angelic messages but through hearing the word of God proclaimed by the announcers of the Gospel (Rom 10:17).  This is called spiritual deafness and most of us are suffering from this kind of illness.

When we stopped listening to the voice of God speaking in the innermost part of our souls, we are spiritually deaf.  When we stopped listening to our consciences and continue with our sinful way of living, we are spiritually deaf.  When we are incapable of communicating to others the message that we ourselves could no longer hear, we are spiritually dumb.  We cannot speak of good things and appreciations to our neighbors, when all that comes out from our mouths are just grudges and negative criticisms, we are spiritually dumb.

Aren’t we deaf when we shut our ears to the invitation of Christ speaking through another brother or sister of the community to stop certain habits, to change certain behaviors?  Aren’t we deaf when we do not hear the cry of the poor, of the outcast, of all those who are victims of injustice?

What is very ironic in this age of modernity is that we always see people, especially the young ones, with earphones plugged in their ears.  They say, so that they can listen clearly to whatever comes out from their phones and so that they won’t disturb others with what they are listening.  But they are just slowly isolating themselves.  No different deaf persons – isolated.  They can’t listen anymore to advice of their parents.

Aren’t we dumb whenever we fail to proclaim the Gospel, when we are ashamed to say that we do not agree with certain options against or not in line with the Gospel?  Aren’t we dumb when we can’t speak of the truth and all we can say are just lies and deceit?

Sometimes we even find it hard to pray to God, to speak to Him, and we find it hard to hear God speaking to us.

Jesus has the power to heal out spiritual deafness and muteness.  Today’s Gospel is an invitation for us to give Jesus an opportunity to touch our tongue to loosen it, spiritually, and to put his fingers in our ears and open them, spiritually.
