Cong. Aris C. Aumentado of Bohol’s second district is the people’s choice.
This, after Aumentado clinched a 92% satisfaction rating from respondents in his district of the latest round of Bohol Polls conducted by the Holy Name University (HNU) –Tagbilaran’sCenter for Research and Publications – with an unprecedented zero dissatisfaction rating.

Aumentado thanked his constituents for the trust and confidence vested in him. He said he sees the high rating as a challenge to do even better for them.

He admits that the fund he has successfully tapped from national government agencies for projects in his district may only be meager and not enough for all their needs. But, he vowed, he will strive even more.

He emphasized that no matter how small such funding may be, he assures them that he will constantly monitor the implementation of the projects to ensure that these are done according to standards and corruption-free.

He said he will not exchange for anything else the joy and satisfaction he feels on seeing the plight of his constituents alleviated with the help of the government.
The solon has been living up to the principles and work ethics of his namesake father and immediate congressional predecessor, Erico Boyles Aumentado, a former congressman and provincial governor.

Top in his projects are those he pursued after his father’s death, including unfinished and pipeline projects: irrigation from the National Irrigation Authority, electrification of the islands from the National Electrification Administration, road improvement through convergence projects of the tourism, and the trade and industry departments with the Department of Public Works and Highways, multipurpose buildings also from DPWH, livelihood from the Department of Labor and Employment, and medicines and medical consultations from the Department of Health, among others.
