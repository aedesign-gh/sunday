Dr. DoloreichDumaluan, the incumbent duly elected president of PDP-Laban in Bohol, said he wants party leadership row settled but time is running out for the filing of certificate of candidacy (COC) is set on Oct. 1-5.

He said this party row is being expected even as he anticipated this beforehand, saying he is willing to relinquish his being the president of the party in a proper way and in accordance with party rules.

Dumaluan reacted to Vice-Gov. DionisioBalite’s claim that he is the chairman of the party in the province, saying there’s no such position (chairman) in the provincial level.

Senator Koko Pimentel might have mistaken in signing Balite’s appointment as interim chairman. There’s a need to rectify this and for Pimentel to revoke such appointment, Dumaluan, the Visayas party secretary-general, said.

Dumaluan, who has been duly elected as party president, urged parties concerned to “respect the party rules and seniority.”

To settle the issue, Dumaluan confirmed that it is through a party provincial assembly wherein duly recognized members gather and vote for their officers in the provincial level. But he admitted there’s no ample time for it.

Dumaluan said that why it appeared that he’s being discredited when he helped Balite in his candidacy when the latter asked for CONA from him in 2016 elections.
Though he admitted that Balite is his “compadre” but he’s only a member as far he’s concerned.

Balite said that he is the interim provincial council chairman of the party that catapulted President Duterte to presidency.

He showed to media interview Friday his officer’s oath of office signed by Sen. Koko Pimentel III as national president.

No other being recognized as PDP-Laban leader except me, Balite said in vernacular.
Meanwhile,  Balite said that he already started restructuring the PDP-Laban leadership in Bohol by appointing Donald Sevilla, Boy Pernia and his son, Board Member Dionisio Victor Balite as district chairman of the first, second and third districts, respectively.

Since last month, he said they have been conducting Basic Membership Seminar (BMS) to neophytes as prerequisite to becoming PDP member based on the principles of the party.
They have already set up municipal chapters all over the province and readied list of candidates under the party in preparation for filing of the COC. (rvo)
