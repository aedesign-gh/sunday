The battle line is drawn between the alliance of Vice-Gov. Dionisio D. Balite and former Carmen Mayor Conchita “Che” Toribiodelos Reyes.

This came as Balite announced on Friday that he is indeed gunning for congressman in third district soon to be vacated by last termer Rep. Art Yap in mid-term election next year.

Earlier, Delos Reyes declared she’s throwing her hat again in the district since the district will vacted by last termer Rep. Arthur Yap next year.

But both parties PDP-Laban of Balite and Delos Reyes’ PartidoFederalismongPilipinas are closely allied and support Pres. Duterte’s administration.

Balite said that nothing can bar him from running this time except for “death.”
Balite said “his decision is anchored also on a family decision and he will not anymore turn his back no matter who are his opponents in the 3rd congessional race.”

He added that “he will not anymore run again as Vice Governor of Bohol as he is already decided for the congressional seat.”

When asked if he is amenable for a negotiation with the camp of former Carmen Mayor CheToribiodelos Reyes, he answered in the negative, however. 

Balite officially told media in a press conference now that he will be running for congressman in the 3rd District of Bohol this coming May 2019 elections.

Balite said his decision is anchored also on a family decision and he will not anymore turn his back no matter who are his opponents in the 3rd congessional race.

Balite asked Boholanos to pray for him so he can continue to serve the interests of the people.

He added that he will not anymore run again as Vice Governor of Bohol as he is already decided for the congressional seat.

Asked whether there is an ongoing negotiation in the camp of former Carmen Mayor CheToribiodelos Reyes, Balite answered in the negative.

Mayor Che is among the possible contenders of Balite for congessional seat in the 3rd district. 

Former Loboc Mayor Leon Calipusan and former Mandaue Hall of Justice Judge Caloy Fernando are also among the possible contenders (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
