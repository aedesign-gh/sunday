MANILA – The administration HugpongngPagbabago (HnP) is looking at the possibility of fielding the tandem of Cong. ArisC. Aumentado of Bohol’s second district and former Vice Gov. Julius Caesar Herrera in next year’s mid-term elections. 

This development is premised on the event that Cabinet Sec.LeoncioEvasco will be persuaded to run against Gov. Edgar M. Chatto in the first district. 

If this materializes, this will be another sequel to the Aumentado-Herrera tandems in the 90s. 

It will be recalled that after winning from opposing camps in 2001, former Gov. EricoAumentado teamed up with Herrera in 2004 and 2007. 

Herrera also remained with Aumentado in 2010 when the former governor was nearly eased out by the group of Chatto, Sec. Arthur Yap, Cong. Rene Relampagos and ex-Cong. Roberto Cajes. 

While Herrera has been lately out of the limelight, Aumentado’s stock continues to rise. 

A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said both Aumentado and Herrera have not been informed of the proposal. In fact, the second district solon said he will finish his term as a congressman.

But an Aumentado-Herrera reunion therefore is not far-fetched, the Hugpong source added. 

Just recently, he posted a 92 percent approval rating in the survey conducted by the Holy Name University, the highest among incumbent officials. 

Evasco had been widely bruited as the administration’s gubernatorial candidate since he was considered for the post by then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte prior to the 2016 elections. 

“Cabsec is being considered to run for Congress because the President needs allies to pursue his development agenda,” a source within Hugpong confided. 

The source spoke on condition of anonymity since the arrangement is still being finalized. 

Evasco has wide experience as an executive and it is doubtful if he will agree to serve as a legislator. 

However, as a loyal Duterte political ally, Evasco is expected to obey if this is the will of the President. In addition, the intensified attacks against Evasco by trusted lieutenants of Chatto might be a factor in the former’s consideration. 

While Hugpong still has to be recognized as a national party, its local partner, the AlyansaBol-anon AlangsaKausaban (Abaka) has started organizing for next year’s election. 

The source disclosed that Abaka-Hugpong will be the undisputed administration party in Bohol contrary to reports that Yap will lead a pro-administration ticket that will include Chatto, Relampagos and Provincial Administrator Alfonso Damalerio II. 
“There is a proposal to arrange for Pres. Duterte and Mayor Duterte to campaign for the Hugpong slate,” the source added. 

In fact, the source said there is a specific request for the two to campaign in areas where the President lost in the last election.
