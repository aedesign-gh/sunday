hl-title: 'POWER BARGE, UP, CLOSE AND PERSONAL.'
hl-desc: 'Cong, Aris C. Aumentado (back to camera) of Boholâ€™s second district takes a picture of the power barge SPC PB 104 docked at the Tapal Port in Ubay town last Friday. Until yesterday, the power barge remains to be energized as the mooring facilities have still to be completed leaving the province still dependent on the power supply from Leyte.'
