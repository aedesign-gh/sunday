The entire province is again facing an abnormal power situation as consumers experienced a total power blackout at almost midnight last Friday.

Power consumers here were roused from their sleep when power supply went kaput at the peak of the feast of the Virgin Mary halting the fiesta celebration in Loon town.

The power blackout lasted for more than two hours and was restored at around 2:30 early dawn the following day. 

But at around 3 o’clock dawn last Saturday, another brownout came in lasting until 4 o’clock dawn.

There was no prior advisory from the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) regarding the power blackout last Friday.

However, Betty B. Martinez, NGCP spokesman, posted in her Facebook account that the unscheduled power interruption was allegedly due to the tripping of the Cebu-Compostela 138 KV lines 1 and 2.

Martinez said the power tripping could be due to a lightning strike.

But at around noontime last Saturday, a short power interruption again occurred aftere Martinez announced that power supply was restored at around 4:25 early dawn of the same day.

The unscheduled power interruption last Friday also affected the provinces of Cebu, Leyte-Samar.

The abnormal power situation has been posted by NGCP either from red to yellow alert due to the shortage of the power supply in the region thereby threatening the power situation in the towns being served by the Bohol Electric Cooperative (BOHECO) facing the so-called rotating brownouts.

This surfaced despite the arrival of a power barge from General Santos City the other week.

The power barge is now docked at the Tapal Port in Ubay town but has not been energized due to the incomplete installation of the mooring site,

The power crisis in Bohol caused by the Leyte earthquake last July remains the same despite the meetings and power presentations of the so-called Bohol Energy Development Advisory Group (BEDAG) chaired by Gov. Edgar M. Chatto.

Earlier, NGCP b ragged the complete restoration of the power lines affected by the Leyte earthquake.

In a press release, NGCP announced that it has fully energized the Ormoc High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) station last Friday.

This means that it is now engaged in a power sharing between Luzon and Visayas grid.
