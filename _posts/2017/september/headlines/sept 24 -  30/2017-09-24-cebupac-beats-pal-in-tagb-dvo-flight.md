The Philippines’ leading airline Cebu Pacific continues to expand its domestic network by adding a new route that will directly link Davao City with Tagbilaran, Bohol ahead of the launching of the flag-carrier Philippine Airlines,
Starting Oct. 21, the carrier’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cebgo, will begin flying between Davao and Tagbilaran four-times-a-week (Tuesdays, Thursday, Saturdays, and Sundays).

Meanwhile, PAL direct flight between Tagbilaran and Davao is set on Nov. 1 yet.
The new Davao-Tagbilaran route establishes a seamless connection for both air passenger and cargo service, ultimately benefitting the economies of the greater Davao area and the province of Bohol. 

“As part of our efforts to improve the overall customer experience for everyJuan, we have been taking to heart the suggestions and feedback from our guests. We’ve looked at the feasibility of the Davao-Tagbilaran route and are optimistic that this new air link will not only answer the clamor from the local communities, but stimulate trade and tourism in both destinations,” said Alexander Lao, President and CEO of Cebgo. 
To officially launch the beginning of this new route, CEB is offering an introductory, all-in seat sale of P599 until Sept. 17 or while seats last. 

Travel period is from Oct. 29 to March 31, 2018. 

Davao serves as the Cebu Pacific hub in Mindanao, linking the city to more places than any other carrier. Cebu Pacific flies directly to Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Dumaguete, Iloilo, Manila, Tacloban and Zamboanga as well as to Singapore. 

Aside from Davao, CEB also operates flights out of five other strategically placed hubs in the Philippines: Manila, Cebu, Clark, Kalibo, and Iloilo. 

The airline’s extensive network covers over 100 routes across 26 international and 37 domestic destinations, spanning Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and USA. 

The latest seat sales can be found on CEB’s official Twitter (@CebuPacificAir) and Facebook pages. Guests may also download the Cebu Pacific mobile app on the App Store and Google Play. 

Cebu Air Inc. is the largest carrier in the Philippine air transportation industry, offering its low-cost services to more destinations and routes with higher flight frequency within the Philippines than any other airline. 

Its 60-strong fleet is comprised of two Airbus A319, 36 Airbus A320 and eight Airbus A330. Between 2017 and 2022, CEB expects delivery of 7 more brand-new Airbus A321ceo and 32 Airbus A321neo aircraft. 

Its wholly owned subsidiary, Cebgo, currently offers flights to 27 Philippine destinations and one international destination, utilizing an exclusive fleet of eight ATR 72-500 aircraft, and six ATR 72-600 aircraft. Cebgo has two strategic hubs in the Philippines namely, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 4 in Manila and Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) in Cebu.
