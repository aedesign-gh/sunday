The Provincial Peace and Order Council (PPOC) in Bohol formalized last week the appeal to transfer to Manila the hearing of the criminal cases filed against dismissed P/Supt. Ma. Cristina Nobleza and her lived-in partner, Reneer Lou Dongon.

Passed via a motion en masse, the council asked that the hearing of the criminal raps against the suspected supporters of the Abu Sayyaf Group.

The passage of the resolution came in the wake of the anxieties expressed by Provincial Prosecutor Macario Delusa over the security risks brought in by the court hearing here against Nobleza and her partner who are both detained in Camp Crame in Quezon City.

The last court hearing against Nobleza was held the other week at the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bohol Branch 48 this city where a barrage of security police escorts were deployed from the city airport up to the court.

Delusa explained that the proposed transfer of the venue of the hearings must be grounded on solid legal bases and of paramount reasons.

The provincial prosecutor said that the hearing if it will continue to be held in Bohol will have an adverse effect on the tourism industry.

Aside from this Delusa noted that expenses to be incurred by the government for the plane fare of Nobleza and Dongon plus their security escorts from Camp Crame. 

Nobleza was earlier accused of trying to rescue the wounded remnants of the bandit group who was in fighting with government troops last April.

Nobleza, using her Nissan Navarra vehicle, forced her way past a military checkpoint in Clarin town in order to allegedly rescue the wounded ASG members who were in hiding.

After Nobleza and Dongon were arrested, criminal charges were filed against them for illegal possession of firearms, obstruction of justice and resistance to authorities.

Because of their security risks, the duo were brought to Camp Crame for custordy.

However, the hearing of the criminal raps are being held in Bohol under legal procedure.

Due to their frequent visitations here, high security measures are being undertaken by the police and the military in the wake of reports of an alleged plan to rescue Nobleza and Dongon by the ASG and their relatives especially that Bohol is nearer to Mindanao and could easily be accessed by supposed rescuers.

Delusa also relayed to the PPOC members the pledge of the police witnesses to travel to Manila if every they are called to testify in the criminal cases.

However, Delusa admitted that the approval of the Supreme Court to allow the transfer of the hearing is difficult as it requires an en banc decision. 

The help of the PPOC and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) of Bohol will give the prosecution a chance to secure the approval of the High Tribunal. (with reports from PIA-Bohol)
