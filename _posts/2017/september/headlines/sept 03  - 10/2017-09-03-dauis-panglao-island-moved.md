A bill is now pending before the House of Representatives seeking to name the Panglao Island into Dauis-Panglao Island.

Cong. Rene L. Relampagos (1st District, Bohol) filed last week a bill seeking to rename Panglao Island to Dauis-Panglao Island.

“It is time to correct records. We all know that Panglao Island is not all Panglao. In fact of the 22 barangays in that island, 12 belong to the municipality of Dauis.” 

Pangalo Island in the first district of the province of Bohol is comprised of two municipalities, namely: Dauis and Panglao. The island has a land area of 94.3 square kilometers.

The municipality of Dauis, one of the oldest town in Bohol. The Assumption of our Lady Shrine Parish and Hinagdanan cave are situated there. On the other hand, the municipality of Panglao is a major tourism destination in the province. It hosts many of the most beautiful beaches in the country. However, for the longest time, the island over which these two municipalities are found is referred to as Panglao Island. 

The lawmaker said the purpose of the bill, really, is to correct geographical misrepresentation, avoid confusion and, most importantly, properly give due recognition to the municipality of Dauis.
In the same vein, the move to rename the Panglao Island Circumferential Road to “Anos Fonacier Circumferential Road (Dauis-Panglao)” is now for consideration in the Senate on Sept. 4, after it has been approved on third reading at the House of Representatives.  

“The change in the name of the road recognizes two important historical and geographical facts: first, it gives due recognition to Mr. Fonacier, the visionary and one of the pillars of Bohol tourism; and second, it gives due recognition to the geographical composition of the island,” he explained.  

Anos Fonacier, who saw the strong potentials of Bohol province as the country’s prime tourist destination, lobbied for infrastructure development in Panglao in the hope that one day Panglao will become a huge tourism attraction. He was the first to bring Bohol to local and international travel and trade fairs and set global standards on tourism and hospitality, drawing in more tourists and investors in the province. 

It was also Fonacier who pushed and advocated the Bohol Tourism Master Plan of 2008 and the creation of the new Bohol airport project. Many tourism policies, programs and projects crafted at the provincial level were guided by his clear vision and genuine efforts to improve and develop Bohol. 

“We hope to pass this bill soon. If passed, this will further bolster our move to rename the island to Dauis-Panglao Island, Relampagos concluded.
