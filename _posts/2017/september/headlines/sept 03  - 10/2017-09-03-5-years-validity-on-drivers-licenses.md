The Land Transportation Office (LTO) in Bohol is now implementing the 5-year validity for driver’s licenses.

Lady Lynn Fuderanan, LTO spokesperson told the Bohol Sunday News that the transactions since Nov. 2 last year until the present are already covered by the validity.

This is as far as Region 7 is concerned, Fuderanan added.

However, the plastic cards for the driver’s license are not yet available in Region 7. The first to have the ID cards are the National Capital Region (NCR), Davao and Region 3.

The release of the plastic cards is expected to be next month or November.

Fuderanan also disclosed that the requirements for the renewal of driver’s license include a medical certificate, negative drug test results and a photocopy of the previous license.

Erwin C. Patalinghug remains to be the LTO registrar here, Fuderanan concluded.

Earlier this week, Sec. Arthur Tugade of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) secured his new driver’s license in Manila within 5 minutes only while the media cameras and photographers all covering him.
