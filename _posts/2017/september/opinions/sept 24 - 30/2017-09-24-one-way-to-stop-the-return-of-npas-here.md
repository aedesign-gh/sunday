In the recent meetings of the Provincial Peace and Order Council (PPOC) the military, in reporting on the internal security situation, has repeatedly mentioned reports of sightings of a band of six (6) to 15 armed men in different barangays of the municipalities of Bohol, particularly in towns that used to be heavily affected by the local communist rebels.  

However when asked to confirm if these were New People’s Army (NPA) elements, Brig. Gen. RanulfoMatanguihan, commanding general of the 302nd Brigade, PA with headquarters in Camp Rajah Sikatuna, Carmen, Bohol, said he could not confirm because there have been no armed encounters yet with this band nor were there documents that were secured or gathered from them.  Earlier, though, there was an intelligence report that about 20-30 NPAs were seen loaded in a banca that proceeded to the direction of Bohol from Negros Island.

Now whether those reported sightings of armed men would later be confirmed as NPAs, the time to do something to stop their return to Bohol is now.  After the directive or order of Pres. Duterte to stop the talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF after their continued armed attacks on the PNP and the AFP camps and even at one time ambushed the Presidential Security troops, we know that the CPP-NPA will continue to make their presence felt throughout the land.  

They will always plan to return to Bohol because it is in furtherance of their ultimate objective to take over power and control of government.

Now whether they will succeed in coming back to Bohol would depend upon the Boholanos because only they could allow or prevent it.  There is one formula, if it can be called one, to keep the CPP-NPA away from the province of Bohol and Boholanos have found this already.

Since their coming in late 70s and their consolidation of forces capable enough to stage ambuscades in the early 80s, the CPP-NPA have gathered enough resources, both human and material, to organize four (4) guerrilla fronts in Bohol by the year 2000 with the 5th in the drawing and organizing stage.

When a guerrilla front is established in an area, i.e. with an armed component of at least a platoon, a complete set of barangay underground government and a sandatahangyunit of political cadres, that area is almost under their total control.  The legal barangay officials are still there but they become puppet officials.  
People pay taxes - revolutionary taxes- according to their means.  The lowliest citizen will pay at least two (2) glasses of rice every week while the richer farmers may be asked to pay one or more cows a month.  This was the situation in some towns of Bohol where the guerrilla fronts have been organized.

This situation however was slowly being reversed from 2000 until February 10, 2010 when the Province of Bohol was declared insurgent-free by the AFP. This means, the armed component – the NPAs- of the communist rebel movement have been forced out of Bohol although their legal fronts have remained, some still active while the others have gone dormant.  These are the same legal fronts that are preparing the grounds for the return of the NPAs when the situation become favourable.

The period from 2000 to 2010 was covered by the provincial administration of Gov. Rene L. Relampagos(1997-2001) and Gov. Erico B. Aumentado (2001-2010) who emphasized his principle of building on the accomplishment of his predecessor.

So what is this formula that was started by Gov. Relampagos and, perfected, so to speak, by Gov.Aumentado that ultimately drove the NPAs out of Bohol?

Actually there is no secret formula.  It was just sheer genuine and honest governance that made the people feel that they were not abandoned by government.  It was genuine public service at work – a government that has a heart for the people and the hands that provide for their needs.  It was a government that did not see insurgency as a military problem but a social and economic problem and therefore calls for social and economic solutions.

It was a provincial local government that accepted the fact that the problem is in its backyard and the responsibility of looking for solution rests in the civilian government and not the military.  The military was called in because the NPAs were bearing arms to enforce their revolutionary government in areas where they have control.  

Thus during the Aumentado provincial administration the military’s role was more on supporting his poverty reduction program than on their punitive mission to crush the communist rebellion. In time the military need not even field their own intelligence officers and men out in the field because then it was already the people who were providing the much needed information.

Gov. Aumentado’s principled public service did not want the communist rebels killed but wanted them to return to normal life with their families.  In time he was able to convince 43 communist rebel leaders to abandon the cause of the revolution to live normal lives with their families. With the help of the national government these former rebels have been given housing and livelihood.  Some of them even chose to live nearby the military camp and headquarters in Carmen whom they now recognize as the military arm of the government.

So, the formula for peace? Presence of genuine government heart and hands in the communities that are vulnerable to deprivation.  If the people don’t see and feel the hands of government service in their midst, they will always be susceptible to the traps of the local communist.
