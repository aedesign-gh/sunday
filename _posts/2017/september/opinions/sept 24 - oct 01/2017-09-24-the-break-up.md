Left leaning organizations from all over the Philippines have already seenthe dawn of the breakup of their alliance with Pres. Duterte. This malaise came in the wake of the Commission of Appointment’s plucking out left leaning officials from the Duterte administration. First to go was Gina Lopez, secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources; Judy Taguiwalo at the Department of Social Welfare and Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano who were both nominated by the Nationalist Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). The Left were disappointed that Duterte did nothing for the retention of their nominees. 

Duterte purged his administration of leftist as instigated by his American educated generals. These generals whose acronym is LEA were instrumental to the stalled peace talk with the government and the NDFP. 

Labor organizations are also disappointed that Duterte was not true to his promise to end contractualization. And they are also ready to severe ties with the president. They claimed that the president is no longer taking positive actions to improve the lives of the workers and the poor.
      
Rep. Antonio Tinio of ACT Teachers said he would convene and consult regional leaders for decision making for a graceful exit from Duterte’s alliance.

Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate announced early this week that the Left is ready to bolt out from the alliance if there is no more basis for its existence.
       
The bitter truth is that we must bear in mind that whoever would take the seat in the office of the president, even if he had an independent mind and guts of Duterte, would surelysuccumb to American hegemony whose tentacles are powerful and far reaching. And a president, prime minister, king or emir had no choice: he has to be an American puppet rather than being removed from office, either by assassination or coup de etat.

We hope to see Duterte finished his term as he means for a better Philippines.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Money is more persuasive than logical argument.
