When God’s attitude offends us

25th Sunday of the Year(cycle A)
Readings:	Is55:6-9; Phil1:20-24, 27a; Mt20:1-16a

Imagine there are four houses on your street in a subdivision.  You own the house at the corner, and it is valued P 4,000,000.00.  The house next to you is valued P 3,000,000.00.  The third house is valued at P 2,000,000.00.  The last house is valued at P 1,000,000.00.

One time, somebody calls you on the phone and you are offered P 5,000,000.00 for your house.  So you sell your house on that day.  The following day you learn that the other owners on your street sold their houses to the same buyer, also.  They told you that they each got P 5,000,000.00.

You are so angry that you call the buyer and told him off.  He responded, “Did I cheat you?  Or are you jealous because I was generous?”

The story is an attempt to put Jesus’ parable in today’s gospel in a modern setting.

To appreciate Jesus’ original parable, we must keep in mind the original setting.  It is the time of grape-harvesting and they must be collected and pressed immediately.  The owners of the great vineyards have a very busy time: they have to prepare and organize the work and, in particular, hire laborers to be sent into the fields.  Those without a fixed job gather at the market place waiting for somebody to hire them for the day.  This is where our parable starts.

Even before sunrise the owner is out looking for laborers.  He hires all those he can find; they agree on the pay and then he takes them to his vineyard.  He must be in a hurry to finish his grape harvesting, because three house later he is out again in the marketplace, looking for more laborers.  He finds some; they agree on the pay they will get and off they go to his vineyards.  He goes out looking for laborers five times and he hires the last group at 5:00 p.m. when there is only one hour of sunlight left to work.  Up to this point the story is just a normal and realistic routine.  The problem arises in the evening when according to the law, the worker must be paid.

In the evening the owner lines up all his workers and begins paying them starting from the last ones he has hired.  And here comes the “evil deed”!  Couldn’t he at least have done it secretly!  No he seems to be doing everything possible to enrage those who have spent a full twelve hours out there in the sun, and are tired out.  And yet it is in this surprising behavior of the owner that we must look for the main teaching of the parable.

Why did Jesus tell the story?  What point was he trying to make?  In real life, who were the early workers and who were the latecomers?

The latecomers were the sinners in Jesus’ time who listened to the preaching and repented.  The early workers were Pharisees who were angry that the sinners repented, entered God’s kingdom late, and were getting the same reward as they.

Jesus rejects the idea of a God who pays according to human merits.  For Jesus, the only attitude to be taken in front of the Heavenly Father is that of a child who does not claim any right, cannot merit anything, who always expects his father to be kind to him.

How is it that it seems so difficult to like a God who loves us and gives up his life and salvation gratuitously?  We do not like him, because if he is so, we, his children, have to be like him.  But we do not want to love gratuitously; that is why His behavior offends us, just as did the behavior of Jesus who preferred sinners to the “just”.

In the Church we should never find people who pretend to deceive more because “they came first”.  Nobody can feel he is a “veteran” because he was converted to Christ before others.  All are equal.  Nobody is the master of the “vineyard”, all are workers.  There is no superior to others.  In the “vineyard of the Lord” one has to volunteer one’s work, nobody must claim higher salary.  No one must do good in order to have a right to a reward in heaven.
