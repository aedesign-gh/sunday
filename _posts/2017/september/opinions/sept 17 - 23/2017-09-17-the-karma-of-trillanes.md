The Karma of Trillanes

Sen. Antonio Trillanes, IV early this weekthreatened to file separate libel cases to two media practitioners namely Ramon Tulfo and MoccaUson.  Trillanes is fuming mad at the two for exposing his alleged bank accounts and hidden wealth abroad which was hinted by Sen. Arthur Gordon last week in their quarrel.

Trillanesis the head of the imaginary “Accusation Committee” in the Senate with Sen. Ping Lacson as his vice chair. They are experts in PREJUDGEMENT who crucified their victims in all forms of social media. The two giggled in glee to see the agony and predicament of their victims.

Last week Trillanes invited Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo R. Duterte and his brother ManasesCarpio at the Blue Ribbon committee in the senate for the alleged P6.4 billion smuggling of shabu at the bureau of customs (BOC). During the sessions Trillanes wanted to see the back of the vice mayor if he is sporting a tattoo of the Triad, that Chinese mafia which specializes in smuggling shabu.

After Trillanes’ challenge to VM Duterte to show his bareback, Trillanes was vilified in all media by caricatures of a thick red lipped gay being tattooed on his back. There are alleged reports that Trillanes was always seen in exclusive gay bars in Makati and Taguig and in Thailand.

VM Duterte said during the hearing that “the law of karma” will catch up with those trying to destroy him and his family.

Now that karma seemed to befall on Trillianes by way of Tulfo and Yuson he seemed to go berserk.

Trillanes was instrumental for the expulsions of Gina Lopez, secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Judy Taguiwalo, secretary of Social Welfare from the cabinet of Pres. Duterte because Lopez was a known environmental activist while Taguiwalo is a die-hard Leftist.Trillianes had bargained with Pres. Duterte that he will stop harping at the Duterte Administration unless he cleans up his administration ofLeftists.  We will cross our fingers if Trillanes will be true to his promise.

QUOTE OF THEWEEK: Spiritual victory comes to those who humble themselves.
