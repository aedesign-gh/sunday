Postponement of barangay polls
andprohibition on spot reports

Two issues are very current today. One is the postponement of the barangay elections and the other is the order of the PNP to ban the media from access to police blotter. 
Both houses of Congress are proposing to postpone the barangay elections scheduled for October this year.  The move is in response to the wishes of Pres. Rodrigo R. Duterte to prevent illegal drug money from influencing the results of the elections. They however differ on how this will be done – postpone and appoint, or postpone and allow incumbent officials on a hold over capacity.

On this issue Dr.MelgieTusoy, DVM , a student of graduate studies in Public Administration at Holy Name University, feels very strongly about the implications of postponement of the barangays elections to local governance.  

She says “The postponement of the Barangay election will surely impinge on the people’s rights to vote. A Barangay is the smallest unit of government in our country. Under Republic Act 7160 otherwise known as the Local Government Code, the Barangay, as the basic political unit, serves as the primary planning and implementing unit of government policies, plans, programs, projects, and activities in the community, and as a forum wherein the collective views of the people may be expressed, crystallized and considered, and where disputes may be amicably settled (Section 384, R.A. 7160). 

“Some important services of the Barangay might be neglected, such as the cleanliness and safety of our neighborhoods, as well as the maintenance of Barangay roads and water systems, barangay-run day care and health centers, keep streets clean and well-lit, and mediate in neighborhood disputes to keep court dockets from getting clogged, among many other services if the elections will be postponed again. 

“On the good side, however, I believe that the postponement of the Barangay election has a far greater advantage than any possible disadvantage. The main reason for the postponement of Barangay elections is "to get rid" of the 40 percent Barangay officials allegedly involved in drugs. The drug problem begins at the grassroots level, therefore, this is where we should start cleansing. In financial aspects, the money that may be saved will be used for infrastructures and public service. Hence, our people, especially the poor will greatly benefit from the funds for social services. 

“Furthermore, killings, violence and cheating during Barangay elections will be also avoided.  Lastly, the possibility that a number of Barangay officials with links to the illegal drug trade who may unwittingly be elected into office will be prevented.
“On the implications of the postponement to the local governance, moving the schedule of the Barangay elections needs an amendment of the law. Without this new law, Barangay elections will push through. The passage of a new law postponing the elections will make all Barangay positions vacant. Therefore, according to the Administrative Code of the Philippines, it is within the powers of the President to fill up declared vacant positions. It would take time (and, some argue, a constitutional amendment) to enable the executive department to appoint caretakers for the Barangays. Postponing would prevent illegal drug operators from influencing the election polls using drug money.”

Now on the issue of prohibiting the media access to police blotter, this has generated protests from media practitioners who used to have open access to police blotters.  It is not clear for what real reason the prohibition has been ordered.  But this recent action of the PNP is in violation of the freedom of expression that is guaranteed under the Constitution of the Philippines.

It is not the reports of the media that are culled from police blotters that are giving the PNP a bad image and reputation.  It is the deviation from police procedure in handling police operations and their responses to reports of criminal activities that have put the police in the bad light.
