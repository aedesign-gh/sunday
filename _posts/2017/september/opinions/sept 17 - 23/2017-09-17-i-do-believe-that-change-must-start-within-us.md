The Gospel of Jesus Christ (September 17, 2017- Sunday) Luke 10:1-9”Therefore said he unto them, the harvest truly [is] great, but the laborers [are] few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest. Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace [be] to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborers is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you:

This gospel encourages us to pray for more laborers in His “vineyard” to build the kingdom of God here on earth. The work to evangelize is absolutely from God and human is just given the privilege to work with God. This means, preaching and serving the people of God are noble jobs to be done heartily by each one of us. Not necessarily that you will go to other places to evangelize but you can do it inside your own families. Not necessarily to speak but to show our examples for them to follow. Action speaks louder than words. A noisy river is shallow while the silent river is deep. But the best if you can live what you speak. My analysis in this world if no one speaks about the goodness of God, this world becomes a world of darkness. Because of this, I encourage anyone whoever you are to speak about God to anyone.

Tel others that God is good and loving them unconditionally. Take note, evil triumphs if good men do nothing. Let us volunteer ourselves for the sake of others. Let us help this world to become a better world to live. I do believe that change must start within us in order to become effective in transforming the image of this earth. The first word to speak if the disciples entered a house is peace. Remember, peace is equivalent to God. Without inner peace in our lives is a manifestation of God’s absent in our inner most being. Without God in our lives, no peace at all. Bring peace to anyone but be sure you have it already in yourself because if not, other people will not believe on you. Prove to them that you are peaceful emotionally despite of the hardships you have experienced everyday in your journey.
