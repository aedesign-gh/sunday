The need for everyone to participate in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities has never been emphasized than it is today.  Destruction in terms of loss of life and damage to infrastructure, agriculture, commerce and industry every time super typhoons strike has become incalculable.  Preparations are never lacking but they are never enough once disaster strikes.  

This is why environmental programs, projects and initiatives to mitigate, if not address, the damaging effects of natural disasters brought about by climate change is coming too many.  Funds can be easily sourced to implement projects that protect, preserve and conserve whatever is left of the environmental resources like our forest in the upland and the mangroves in the coastal areas. Our forest lands and the trees that grow on them are our best defense and protection against natural disasters like flooding and erosion and natural phenomenon like storms and typhoons.

But at the rate we reduce our forest lands, we may have only a few years left before we lose our agricultural farms to floods and erosion. Let me give you a little background. Some 24% or about 7,162,000 hectares of the Philippines is forested.  Of this 11.6% or roughly 829,000 hectares is classified as primary forest – the most biodiverse form of forest.  But we are losing an average of 262,500 hectares every year or 2.48% to change in forest cover.  From 1990 to 2005 alone, we lost 32.3% or 3,412,000 forest cover to habitat conversion.  DENR defines habitat conversion as change in forest area plus change in woodland area minus net plantation expansion.

Thus unless everybody appreciates these statistics and resolve to do something to help, we are still facing big environment problem and may contribute a little to climate change mitigation.

DENR today is deep in the implementation of its National Greening Program (NGP) that is being carried out through the peoples organizations (POs) in the upland communities.  There is sense in engaging the POs to implement the project.  After all who can do it better and continue to nurture and protect the trees that they plant better than those who are themselves living in the area or locality where the project is to be implemented?

Now, another project, the Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project (INREMP) is being implemented by DENR through a loan and grant portfolio provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Climate Change Fund (CCF) and the Global Environment Fund (GEF).

The project involves the restoration of forest lands in the denuded watersheds of the four (4) river basins of the country – the Chico Upper River Basin in the Cordillera Administrative Region, the Wahig- Inabanga River Basin in Bohol of Region 7, the Bukidnon River Basin in Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental, and the Lake Lanao River Basin in Regions 9 and 10 in Mindanao.

The project aims to restore denuded forest lands through the various natural resources management (NRM) interventions like reforestation, assisted natural regeneration (ANR), agro-forestry, commercial tree plantation, conservation farming and community-based protection and monitoring of natural forests.  It also aims to reduce poverty incidence in the locality by 25% from their 2014 levels.

For lack of material time to raise fruit tree seedlings for its 2017 target, INREMP has decided to just procure the seedlings but the problem is that Bohol does not have BPI accredited nurseries except for the one in Alicia but it is only raising coffee seedlings.

If it is not in the priority of the government in Bohol to go into fruit tree production, it is high time that it reconsiders its priority programs on agriculture.  Long gone is the myth that the soil in Bohol is not suited for growing fruit trees that command high demand in the market.  Our farmers in Bohol have proven that rambutan, lanzones, cacao, coffee and even durian grow very well and bear fruits very well too. 

For now DENR has to go to Bukidnon, Davao and Zamboanga to look for the fruit tree seedlings to meet its 2017 target of more than 50,000 asexually propagated seedlings of rambutan, cacao, lanzones, calamansi, and durian.

If the province of Bohol is committed to contribute to climate change mitigation and resiliency, it will be well to include growing high value fruit trees in the province.
