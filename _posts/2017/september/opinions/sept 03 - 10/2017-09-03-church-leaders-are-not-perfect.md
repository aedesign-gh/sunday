22nd Sunday of the Year (cycle A)
Readings:	Jer 20:7-9; Rom 12:1-2; Mt 16:21-27

Whenever a church leader, he may be a bishop, a priest, or a lay leader, commits a mistake, it is expected that tons of criticisms will be hurled against him.  We all heard people criticizing church leaders in form of gossips, in writing and most especially in the social media.  People love to indulge upon scandals committed by church leaders.

One reason for this is that people are expecting that church leaders should live up the ideals of what the church is preaching.  Another is that people are thinking that church leaders should be perfect.  So whenever a church leader commits mistake it would be a great frustration for some.

Reflecting on our readings this Sunday, we will come to know on some truths on how God choose his servants.  In our Gospel we heard Jesus called Peter as Satan after Peter reproached Jesus when Jesus told them about his imminent suffering and death.

We should take note that our Gospel today is a continuation of last Sunday’s Gospel in which Jesus asked his disciples who he for them.  It was Peter who answered correctly that Jesus is the Messiah and because of Peter’s profession of his great faith in Jesus that Jesus told Peter that it will be upon him that Jesus will build his church.  Together with this building of the church Jesus entrusted to Peter the keys of the Kingdom thus making Peter a steward and at the same time a leader of the church that Jesus instituted.

It was indeed a great honor for Peter to become a leader of this church.  However, in our Gospel today, we heard of Jesus rebuked Peter for his mistake.  Nevertheless, Jesus did not withdraw his words on Peter on becoming a leader of the church.  Peter remained to be a leader of the apostles and of the instituted as much as his human frailty also remained.  Later in the Gospel we will again hear in the Gospel of Peter denying Jesus three times when Jesus was captured and yet again Jesus entrusted to Peter his sheep after his resurrection.

When God calls a person and entrust to him a mission to lead his people, God never takes away the person’s imperfection.  God does not turn that person into a perfect being and be exempted from committing mistakes or error.  He remains to be human, weak and imperfect, just like anybody else.

Human as he is, the God’s servant will also feel pain, despair, and frustrations.  In our first reading today we heard how the prophet Jeremiah expressed his despair.  He was so frustrated when his words not only fell on deaf ears, but they also arouse a violent persecution against him.  What happened to Jeremiah have shocked him badly and threatened his psychological equilibrium.  This is when he cries of grief we are reading today rise from his heart.

This is how Jeremiah is feeling now: abandoned by God, alone against all, the object of scorn and violence on the part of the people.  Why did God call him to undertake a mission that is going to be a complete failure?

The experience of Jeremiah is repeated in the case of all those who are called by God and accept to carry out a special mission in their lives.  Sufferings and persecutions will be inevitable.  It is good they know this from the start, because God does not want to deceive anybody.

God had not promised his servants an easy and honored like as much as He does not take away their humanity and imperfections.  He had just invited to his to be a leader of His people despite his imperfections.  The church leader responded to this call and in spite of all the suffering and frustrations he had to go through, he will be finally convinced that it is worthwhile.
