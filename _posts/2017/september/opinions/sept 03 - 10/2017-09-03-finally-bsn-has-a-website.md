When we say BSN, we are not referring to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing nor are we referring to the “Bana sa Nurse” in the United States.

Bart Auza, our former co-faculty member at the then Divine Word College of Tagbilaran introduced as the word BSN.

He said BSN has four levels, the first level is the one we mentioned. The second level is “Boy sa Nurse” while the third one is Binuhi sa Nurse while in the US.

Well, we have to add one level in the case of our friend, Bart Auza. BSN now means Biyodo sa Nurse (BSN).

Whatever, when we say BSN, we are referring to Bohol Sunday News which now have its own website.

It was quite climactic on our part to come up with our own website after we constructed a separate website to the defunct Bohol Standard which we tried to publish following the death of the late Atty. Alexander H. Lim.

We have been egged to come up with a new website. However, we have been searching for a web constructor for almost six months now due to the fact the most of them are quite busy.

But a two weeks ago, we finally found a web constructor just in our midst and we are quite happy with his presentation of the new website of the Bohol Sunday News at www.boholsundaynews.com.ph which can be accessed through Mozilla Firefox and Google.

Although we are still trying to make improvements in our new website but rest be assured that the items published therein are up to date.

Apparently, we are no longer confined to our Facebook fan page. We are now happy to share our articles to our dear readers in the Internet.

Again, we wish to thank our web constructor whose identity would like to remain as secret and confidential.

At any rate, welcome to our new website where the real competition in the fourth estate is on.
