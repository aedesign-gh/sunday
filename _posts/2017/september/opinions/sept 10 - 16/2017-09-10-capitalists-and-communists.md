Communists say, “Economics determines everything in society”. Capitalists say, “Making a lot of profit out of business is the most important thing”. They seem to be saying the same thing. Are they not worshippers of Mammon? Just asking.

News item: Calape woman charged for cybersex. I suspect there’s more out there. And “kwarta padala” or money transfer institutions might be a good place to start looking.

Congratulations to all Outstanding Boholanos. But, in a different context, here is my list of “Outstanding Boholanos” from among the poor and simple ones:  honest tricycle drivers who return items left in their vehicles; local food vendors who continue to keep their goods clean and healthy; non-government community organizers who sincerely work for their programs due to their pro-poor advocacies and not just for the money in projects; church workers, regardless of religion, who respect others who belong to faith groups different from theirs; and many other nameless heroes.

News item:  11 towns without fire station. My question is, do they even have a good water system? What are fire trucks for without water sources?
