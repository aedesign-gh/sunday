Early this year, we started monitoring the movements of Cabinet Sec. Jun Evasco within the four corners of Bohol.

The former Maribojoc town mayor is in every nook and corner of this island province.

We followed his appearances in every social gatherings including foundation days, town fiestas, reunions, etc. and we already lost count.

Then the major and minor premises started to formulate and leads to the inevitable conclusion that Evasco is a probable gubernatorial candidate in 2019.

Well, let history be the judge in the future.

In the first place, that is the least of our concern. The political considerations behind the movements of the no. 1 Boholano seated in Malacanang behind the Duterte consideration is not also in the mind of Evasco.

Our concern is how can Evasco survive the political positioning of people who are against Duterte prior and during the 2016 presidential elections.

The political manuevers of the Liberal Party leaders in Bohol is quite awesome after Duterte assumed the presidency.

Bohol became the favorite visiting place of LP bigwigs like Leni Robredo, Senators Laila de Lim, Kiko Pangilinan, Bam Aquino, Risa Hontiveros and even Antonio Trillanes IV.

But under the Duterte administration, Bohol has become a no man’s land for these yellowtards.

The paradigm shift is now focused on NEDA Sec. Ernesto Pernia and most importantly, Evasco.
Some of the media outlets here considered as sister companies of the Capitol have started toying with Evasco who is the only key to the gates of Malacanang.

Thus, we are not after if Evasco runs for governor or not in the next political exercise. 
Our concern is who can he withstand the political positioning of the LP stalwarts in Bohol.
At the end of the day, we can only be assured that in the mind of Evasco is a revolutionary mentality that could easily put down the traditional method in any political configuration.
We still do not lost our belief in Evasco’s mind setting. Although along the process, we are aware how slow is the Cabinet secretary in the manuevers in Malacanang contrary to the power being wield by Bong Go there.

At any rate, we do not become jealous how Evasco rub elbows with personalities we consider as enemies. Welcome to our parlor.
