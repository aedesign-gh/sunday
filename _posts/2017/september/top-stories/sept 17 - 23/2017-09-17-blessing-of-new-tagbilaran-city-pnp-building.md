Mayor Yap who donated a parcel of land from the city government's property, also shelled out P1 million for its construction. The local chief executive has been consistently supporting the city PNP ever since he assumed office.During his first term, Mayor Yap gave four 4-wheeled vehicles to the unit. After which, he distributed motorcycles which they used for the Motorcycle Anti-Street Crime Operative (MASCO). The city government also provided ammunitions, additional office staff and gasoline. Further, budget was provided for the creation of the Special Weapons Action Team (SWAT) which would also be furnished with helmets, bullet proof vests, service truck and 10 M-4 rifles. He also deployed force multipliers in every barangay, the Active Local Response Team (ALERT). Construction of the sub-stations and outposts in every district is already on the drawing board. Just recently, Brgy. Ubujan completed theirs. Alongside with these initiatives was the installation of high definition CCTVs in the strategic points in Tagbilaran including all the public schools in the City. Two mountain bicycles were also given by the city government to the “Bicycle Cops" which was launched last May.According to Degay, two major things were accomplished through the “Bicycle Cops” program -- the physical health conditioning of the city PNP personnel and monitoring and patrolling of areas which cannot be accessed by regular police vehicles. Degay said the project also increased the police visibility. 

During the program, Espino commended Mayor Yap for his unwavering support to the city PNP and promised that these would motivate them to continually exercise their mandate of protecting and serving the people.
