TRINIDAD.- The rumble of the bass and tomtoms, the cracking of the snare drums and the smartly costumed majorettes, minorettes, flag bearers and twirlers again drew the unusually large throng of a united crowd as 21 elementary and 6 secondary drum and lyre corps pound and trot to add excitement to the 70th Founding Anniversary of this town.
Trinidad Mayor Judith Cajes said the tradition of the drum and lyre competition has been among the crowd-drawing highlights of the town's anniversary.

Started in 2007, the drum and lyre competition this year is on its 10th year and has been something pupils from all barangays look forward to annually as a rare occasion to showcase the people's musicality, Cajes volunteered the information.

School based drum and lyre groups compete in complete costumed uniforms, felt hats, berets, marching boots, overflowing tassels, sheer silks and metallic epaulets dominate the overall performances set for each contingent which is given 10 minutes of showdown for drum rolls and beat dancing antics.

“We want our children to know they are a part of the town's future and having them in celebrations like this, this instills in them the value of unity and participation, cooperation and discipline,” Cajes added.

“It has also become a family affair, while barangay residents descend to the town for the annual foundation celebrations, they also look at the kids and their performances,” shared a teacher trainer who has brought her schools contingent to the competitions 7 times.
The drum and lyre corps competition is just one of the many Founding anniversary highlights.

Established September 1, 1947, Trinidad town came from the neighboring barangays of Ipil and named after President Manuel Roxas' wife.

This year on its 70th, town officials led by Mayor Cajes and Vice Mayor Manuel Garcia set a 4 day celebration.

Last August 30, town's college Trinidad Municipal College fought in a basketball match against Bohol Institute of Technology Talibon at the municipal gym when the town hosted the Bohol Schools Athletic Association matches.

The town's karomatas filled with the barangays’ best products spilled to the streets in an usual parade reminiscent of the thriving historic barter trade along the Ipil river during the Spanish times.

The parade also peaked to an opening of the annual AgroFair at the town's Corazon Aquino People's Park highlighted by the Karomata Festival Ritual Dance.

In the afternoon, the annual Tanod Drill took to the Parade Grounds at the Peoples Park.
The annual Tanod Drill also apexed with the annual Arnis Competition, one of the pioneering acts for barangay peace keeping teams in Bohol.

A largely agricultural town, Trinidad also paid tribute to its farm animals in a race that pitted barangay carabao entries in a race that has become another event must sees.
By September 1, people woke up to the traditional Diana which also announces the anniversary mass to start an hour later.

An anniversary parade ensued followed by the Anniversary Program which had the town's folks listen to the State of the Town Address by the chief executive.

This also set the stage for the annual drum and lyre corps competition.

As the drum rumble faded, competition judge Ariel Fullido announced the winners much to the eagerly awaiting crowd.

In the elementary category, Hinlayagan Ilaud earned two distinguished awards: Most Disciplined and Best in Choreography while La Union Elementary School DLC won the Best in Costume and Trinidad Elementary School won the best in instrumentation.

The secondary category proved to be a nail biting competition.

In the end however, Alturas Drumbeat Champion and defending for the crown contingent proved to be too much for the other high school drum and lyre teams.

Saint Isidore Academy snatched three awards: Most Disciplined, Best in Costume, Best in Choreography while Hinlayagan National high School won the Best in Instrumentation award, according to Fullido. (rahc/PIA-7/Bohol)
