BABA ON ATTRACTING BUSINESS TO CITY. The City Investment Council (CIC) chaired by City Mayor Baba Yap recently had its 3rd meeting to finalize the Incentive and Investment Code of Tagbilaran City. CIC which came about through Executive Order No. 14 outlined its core duties of reviewing and updating the existing Local Incentives and Investment Code of Tagbilaran which includes preparing preferred areas of investments, promulgating supplementary rules and regulations, granting of incentives to qualified investors, processing and approving applications for incentives availment, deciding on controversies concerning the implementation of the investment code, checking and verifying the compliance of the registered enterprises and the cancellation or suspension of the benefits. Long overdue, this code is papered over by the various stakeholders in the City, all looking forward to an investment driven Tagbilaran -- but striking a balance among the principles of environmental sustainability, employment opportunities and revenue generation.
