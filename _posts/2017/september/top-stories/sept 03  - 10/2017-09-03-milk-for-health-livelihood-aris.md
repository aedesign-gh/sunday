AUMENTADO

By JUNE S. BLANCO

LET’S drink to that!
But not any alcoholic drink. Rep. Erico Aristotle Aumentado’s (Bohol, 2nd District) was thinking of fresh cow’s milk when he said that.

This after the solon met another big-time investor looking at establishing an “invisible” ranch in several towns in the second district suitable for the raising of dairy cows.
Aumentado said the investor will initially provide Napier grass planting materials of the variety from Vietnam. This variety, he echoed the investor as saying, has higher protein content best suited for milk production in dairy cows.

When the Napier has grown and is ready for fodder, the investor will bring in the dairy cows from Australia.

When properly fed and cared for, these cows can produce up to 40 liters of milk a day – for which the investor will pay with cash. This means additional income on a daily basis for the farmer-beneficiaries.

Aumentado eyes Tlibon, Ubay, Sagbayan and Dagohoy – these being town with still vast agricultural lands – as pilot for the project.

He said the project is in line with the thrust of the National Dairy Authority.
To note, the Philippines is an active partner in the huge dairy market. Dairy is a P3-billion industry of which the Philippines consumes 6 percent – imported largely from New Zealand and Brazil.

This augurs well for a Philippines-based dairy production center. Consider that the industry is still in its infancy in the country, especially in Bohol, Aumentado said he sees it fit to start with something manageable, like production at the farmer’s level with the feeds he produces himself hence, less overhead cost.

The farmer will have no problem marketing the milk either, because the investor will buy all production for pasteurization as fresh milk, or processing into other dairy products.
