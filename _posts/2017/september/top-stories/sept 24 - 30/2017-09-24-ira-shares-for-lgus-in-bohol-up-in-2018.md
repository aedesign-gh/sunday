The Loccal Government Code of 1991, provides “40% of Bureau of Internal Revenue's annual collection goes to LGUs.” This is being divided into: 23% for the provinces, 23% for cities, 34% for municipalities, and 20% for barangays.”

Every IRA share is divided in the manner: “50% according to population; 25%, land area; 25%, equal sharing. Allocations for barangays, on the other hand, are determined through population (60%) and equal sharing (40%).” IRA, according to DBM, is the source of the so-called 20% development fund of every LGU for defined development projects.

Accordingly, the total IRA is divided for 42,028 Barangays; 1,491 municipalities; 143 cities, and 80 provinces in the entire country based on National Statistics Coordination Board, reports said.

The increase (IRA share) is reportedly due to the of efficient tax collection of the national government in collaboration with the LGUs. (rvo)
