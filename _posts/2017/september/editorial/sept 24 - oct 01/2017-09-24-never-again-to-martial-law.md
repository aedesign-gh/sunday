It's a scene we have seen so many times before.

Protesters shouting anti-government and anti-president slogans, burning effigies of the incumbent and calling for anarchy in the name of change.

These are veterans of the numerous political upheavals that have time and again plunged the Philippines into chaos.

On one hand there are the yellows and on the other there are the reds.

They were hand in hand at least twice before: in the 1986 Edsa People Power revolt against Ferdinand Marcos, in the 2001 Edsa 2 against Joseph Estrada, and others in between.

They were on opposite sides of the political fence during the incumbencies of Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III. 

In these four administrations, it was the yellows who ran the show while the reds did what they have always done: rain curses on the incumbents in the streets while their comrades carried on perhaps the longest insurgency in the world in the countryside.
So what's new?

No one will be good enough for the communists except one named Jose Ma. Sison.

No one else will be good for the yellows notwithstanding the years of incompetence and corruption under their watch.

Now here comes Rodrigo Duterte. He is neither yellow nor red - despite his claims to leftist sentiments - in form and in substance.

The yellows are hoping they can reprise Edsa 1 and 2 and install LeniRobredo.

The reds are hoping they get a bigger share of the largesse than they did in 1986 and 2001 knowing fully well the touted "liberation" has only gone farther than ever.

Today, they shout "Never Again!" to Martial Law ignorant to the reality that it is on its fourth month in Mindanao with hardly a stir and nary a complaint.

This means that Duterte only needs to expand it, perhaps first in the Visayas and then Luzon.

They are clueless that at no other time in the nation's history, the Army and the police are fanatically behind the President.

And they disregard the fact that this time, majority (86% and counting) are solidly behind Duterte in the face of the most savage demolition job that has shown mainstream media at its worst.

If chaos breaks out in the streets cleared of students, workers, ordinary folks and even the police due to the holiday which Duterte shrewdly declared, the President will be given the justification he needs. 

"Never Again!" to Martial Law? Think again. (CHITO A. FUENTES)
