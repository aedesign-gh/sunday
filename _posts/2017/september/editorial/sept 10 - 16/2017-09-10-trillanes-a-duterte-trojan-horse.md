Is it possible for Sen. Sonny Trillanes to be a Duterte trojan horse?

The answer is obvious.

At the rate Trillanes has been throwing the sink not only at Pres. Duterte but also his children, no one will even remotely consider him that.

And yet, Trillanes can actually be a closet Duterte supporter.

The last episode where Trillanes vainly tried but failed to get Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte to strip before the august body might be a clue to where the senator's real sentiments lie.
The pathetic script where Trillanes wanted the younger Duterte to confirm his accusation that the latter is a member of the Triad was one more argument for the establishment of a revolutionary government.

Trillanes showed that the Senate can be manipulated by the most brazen operator to destroy and malign just about anybody.

Indeed, even the presidential son and son-in-law can be subjected to stupid but humiliating line of questioning in what is supposed to be an honorable body by one of its own members.Â 
So how does a tattoo prove involvement in drug smuggling?

Even if, for the sake of argument, Vice Mayor Pulong does sport a dragon tattoo, that does not automatically establish his guilt in the drug smuggling case.

No, Trillanes was not going to prove anything close to presidential kin's participation in the crime being investigated by the Senate.

Not by a mile.

But, as he has repeatedly shown, Trillanes does not care. Perhaps, he isn't aware that he is fooling no one this side of sanity. Perhaps, he is aware but goes through the process just the same for reasons best left to the imagination.

But Trillanes did accomplish a couple of things.

First, it showed the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Liberal Party and yellows. Trillanes shows they have nothing left to offer as a decent alternative to a Duterte presidency.

Second, it cemented many people's sentiments that the Philippines can do without a Senate, at least like the one we have now.

Gone are the glory days when the likes of Claro M. Recto, Lorenzo Tanada, Jose Diokno, Jovito Salonga and many others walked its hallowed halls.

Now, one who cannot tell the difference between a democrat and the Nacionalista Party makes a mockery of its investigative powers for his own (and those of his patrons') selfish agenda.

At the rate Trillanes is turning the Senate into his own private circus, it won't be long before the Filipino people decides once and for all to bury it in favor of a more responsive and relevant legislative body, the federal form which the President is espousing.

Trillanes a Duterte trojan horse? He might not be aware of it, but Trillanes might yet deliver what Duterte's legislative allies can't. (Chito A. Fuentes)
