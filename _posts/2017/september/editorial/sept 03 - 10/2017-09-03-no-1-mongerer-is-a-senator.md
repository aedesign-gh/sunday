The Presidential son-in-law, Atty. Mans Carpio, was right when he said that Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV is a rumor-mongerer.

Trillanes has made the Senate as a zarzuela using his histrionics as his capital without even using his heads which led us to question why he was voted as a Senator.

In filing an ethics case against Trillanes, Sen. Richard correctly point out that the Oakwood mutineer has used the Senate as a forum, used his agenda against his enemies and to satisfy his megalomaniac desire for his own self. 

“He is so full of himself without listening to any person in his desire for propaganda," Sen. Gordon said.

"Truly, now is the opportune time to arrest this despicable pattern of behavior which is trifling this institution," he added.

We noticed how Trillanes tried to make the Senate hearing on the P6.5 billion worth of shabu involving the Bureau of Customs as a launching pad of his diatribe againstg the Dutertre administration.

After he was not made as a tandem of the President, he started his attacks against the Punisher, throwing all accusations possible under the heat of the sun. Apparently, no one believes this rumor-mongerer.

Pres. Duterte called Trillanes as a “trililing” apparently referring to his empty allegations against him.

Now that Vice-Mayor Paolo Duterte of Davao and Carpio are summoned to the Senate next week, expect Trillanes trying to pin down the duo and implicate the President to corruption.

We want to have the next Senate elections and wanted Trillanes to seek the people’s mandate once again.

The only capital why Trillanes won a Senate seat was the disgruntlement of the voters during the incumbency of former Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who has chosen to be aligned with the Duterte administration.

Sans the sentiment against the Arroyo administration, let us try to see if this No. 1 rumor-mongerer can still have the people’s mandate. Otherwise, Trillanes will rot in the dog house. It will.
