Cabinet Sec.LeoncioB. Evasco,Jr., the second top ranking official of the land and the privy of Pres. Rodrigo R. Duterte, disclosed last Monday during the opening of Escuela Taller in Mariobjoc that the president is grateful to the Boholanos because 80 percent of theBoholano electorates voted for him as president of the Philippines. 

Evasco said Pres. Duterte reciprocated to the Boholanosby making Bohol as his priority in terms of infrastructure projects. One of the projects is the construction of a new hospital in Cortes town located on a ten-hectare lot of the defunct Rolling Mills with awhooping budget of P600 B. It will become the new spacious provincial hospital complete with upscale medical facilities.

On the same occasion,CabSecEvasco disclosed that the ancient wharf of Maribojoc, the hub of commerce after the Second World War which was condemned by the Coast Guard as a dead port will, be renovated with an astronomical budget of P500 Billion. The wharf will become the biggest state-of-the art container port in Bohol, if not in the Visayas region, coupled with areas reservedfor refrigerated cargoes.
By January next year, the residents along the causeway to the wharf will be relocated to the hills of Maribojoc to pave the way of the initial works of the renovation. Fr. Jinggoy Saco, parish priest of Maribojoc, had already bought a parcel of land for the relocation of those who will be displaced becausethe causeway will be widened with two lanes on both sides of the road.

On the other hand, CabSecEvasco revealed that the feasibility studies of the Opon, Cebu to Bohol bridge is now in full swing. He added that studies of Ubay, Bohol to Leyte bridge is also being conducted so that these two multi billion peso project  could be implemented and materialized soon.
The President’s privy said there are many projects the president have in mind for Bohol, but it is still too early to reveal.

Duterte is the only President who does not have a political career to protect. That is why he is not beholden to any business tycoon who has hefty unpaid taxes. He is asking these tycoons to pay or they will be circumcised for the second time. Critics would say Digong have done nothing, but they had overlooked that millionaires who are tax evaders trooped to the nearest office of the BIR.
