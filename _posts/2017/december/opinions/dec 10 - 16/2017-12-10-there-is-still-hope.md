I do not envy the plight of politicians. They always find themselves in various instances of dilemma and had to make serious compromises to their principles. It is a sad testament to our political system in the country. It is one of patronage politics.

During elections, even if you do not drink liquor, if you are a candidate, you have to buy liquor for nasty voters who standby in sari-sari stores who shout at you, “Way bay tagaydiha Sir?” (Shall we not have a drinking spree, sir?) To top it all, you have to give “inangayan” (supposedly the voter’s share of the budget) in order to ensure victory at the polls. And if you compute your salary during your whole term, it usually yields a deficit. You shall have spent more than you earned; a recipe for corruption.

That brings us to recent events in our national political life that wrecked havoc on the ideals of some of our political leaders. There are those who belong to devout Roman Catholic families whose parents are known Pro-Life advocates. But their family members who currently hold political positions happen to be at the mercy of national officials, and had to compromise and vote in favor of death penalty. Then, they try to save their faces by saying, it is what most of their constituents want anyway. But deep in their hearts and Christian conscience, they know it is wrong.

But all is not lost. There are still government officials like Secretary DelfinLorenzanaof the Department of National Defense who think with clarity and sensibility. This gives us hope. Even in our province there are political leaders who stood against the Reclamation Project in Panglao and won their case in court. There are Boholano leaders who opposed the siphoning of the water fromInabanga to Cebu in order to protect the rights of Boholanos. They also prevented the monopoly of Korean investors in a proposed carageenan planting project throughout the province also to protect the interest of Boholano farmers and fisherfolks. There are leaders who stood, and continue to do so, to prevent the proliferation of Genetically-Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Bohol. May their tribe increases.
