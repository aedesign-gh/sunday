Special Gospel of the Day (Dec.3, 2017-Sunday) John 4:43-54” As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was living. So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him." 

So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives"; and he himself believed and his whole household. This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.

For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country: Too much familiarity will lead a bias judgment. It was happened to Jesus because of too much closeness and attachment to the people whom he associated for three decades, he was rejected. 

Be careful because sometimes, you judge your pastor, priest and the people who serve and care your spiritual life. You respect is diminished for knowing the background of this person. If you are a real Christian, obey their teachings but not their doings if ever, it is contradicting to their teaching. Matthew 23:3”therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them.

Let us rewind the past event that Jesus performed: the miracle at Cana where the water turned into wine. This is a very wonderful event because it proves that in God everything is possible. 

Do not forget to invite God in your marriage, family, occasions, celebrations, finances and businesses because if scarcity takes place, there is God who can supply the necessary things for your sake. Look at the Royal official who came to Cana because he thought that Jesus was there since the miracle of wine took place in this scared place. 

It is the same to us many times since we go to different shrines because we believe the holiness of this place due to constant God’s manifestations in this area. If you have necessities in life, just recall the past miracle in your life. Just believe that Jesus has never changed. Hebrews 13:8”Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
