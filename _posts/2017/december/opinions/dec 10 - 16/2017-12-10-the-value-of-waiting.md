People have different reactions when it comes to waiting.  For some people to wait is a kind of torment.  Especially for those who are impatient.  In this age of technology when we are pampered with convenience and easy life to wait is an issue.  We are used with the instant mentality.  We can just compare that before to send a message to another place would take some time, but now we can send a message with our cellular phones.  Cooking takes time, and so many prefer fast foods.  Somehow this age of convenience has diminished our ability to wait and hence we become more impatient.  These people somehow become slaves of time because for them to wait is a waste of time.

For some, waiting is not an issue. Some people can wait for a long time without any complaints.  These people have a great deal of patience.  They are not bound by time.  They do not let time control them.  They may be not time conscious or simply they just have a lot of patience.

This Sunday marks the beginning of the Advent Season, a preparation and a waiting time for the coming Christmas in which we commemorate the birth of our Lord.  This season, we are taught of the value of waiting.

God has created boundaries around every event in our lives—there is always a beginning and an end—and it is a mistake for us to break through those hedges. It’s a vital principle of guidance for a Christian never to move out of the place in which she is sure God has placed her, until she hears from Him—waiting on and for God is time spent, yes, but never time wasted!

Waiting takes time! God is not bound by time, though, and he lives and reigns, today (describing our time), in eternity (his)! The past, present and future are all together with him and he is there! God does not have a past, a present or a future! While we remain tethered to time, he works in and through us within that framework. All of the events, situations and circumstances that God allows to come into our lives are bounded by time, so that we can endure them—they have a beginning and an end.

Knowing that God dwells in eternity while we live in time will go a long way to help us practice waiting on and for God. When we wait on God, he may be waiting until we are ready. And when we wait for God, we may be waiting until he is ready. We need to remember and acknowledge that God is Sovereign and rules over all the earth! He is in control of everything and, therefore, he’s never out of control. The world is out of control, but God is not! God will take our out-of-control lives and bring them to order if we will submit to his plans and his rule in our lives. 

God can give us such a clear exercise in waiting right at this time of the year.  Some of us can’t wait for Christmas to come while harried others can’t wait until it’s all over. And God knows all about our individual needs. We are to make plans, yes, but we need to give them over to the Great Creator and Editor to make any changes he knows are necessary. Scripture says that ishow our Sovereign Lord operates, if we are just willing to wait.

There are two kinds of waiting.  One is the passive waiting and the other is active waiting.  There is the waiting of the person who went hunting during the night in the forest, lost his way, and awaits the rising of the sun.  He does nothing, keeps still, and just lets the time pass.  Passive waiting is when you sit there as if you’re on a recliner, waiting for things to be brought to you.  You’re not going to get your own drink, remote control or rug for the knees.  You’re totally reliant on others to get it for you and you’ll wait as long as you need to, complaining to everyone within earshot if it doesn’t come quickly enough.

Then there’s active waiting, which is what you do when you’re in the line for a ride at a theme park.  You’re excited, anticipating what’s coming, sharing the joy with those around you and knowing that you’re getting ever closer to your goal.  You may be waiting, but you’re also making progress.  It is like a girl who has been invited to a party.  How does she use her time while waiting for her lover to come and accompany her?  She does not stay idle: she prepares herself.

Christians do not laze around as they wait for the Lord.  They work and prepare a new world by collaborating in building it.  And yes, it does need a big deal of patience and hope.
