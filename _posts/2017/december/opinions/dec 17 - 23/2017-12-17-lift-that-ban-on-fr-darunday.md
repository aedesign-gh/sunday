For some packs of cigarette and dried tobacco leaves that the Jail Guards found inside a package brought by Fr. James Darunday inside the Bohol District Jail (BDJ) a few week ago, he is now permanently banned from performing his ministry inside the BDJ.

Fr. Darunday celebrates mass regularly for the inmates of BDJ as part of his duties as a Catholic priest and being one assigned by the Bishop of the Diocese of Tagbilaran to minister to the inmates who are confined in prison.

The other week before going to the BDJ to celebrate mass for the inmates there, a wife of one of the inmates asked Fr. Daunay if he could bring along with him some provisions that she was sending to her husband at the jail since she could not go there herself.  The good Fr. Darunday that he is consented to delivering the provisions.  In fact when he arrived at the entrance of the BDJ he told the guards on duty to inspect the goods that he brought since it was only requested by the wife of the inmates and he did not know what was inside the package.  Fr. Darunday knows the rules and regulations regarding goods being sent to the inmates.That was when the guards discovered the packs of cigarette and some dried tobacco leaves.  And for that he is permanently banned from coming to celebrate mass for the inmates which he did for the last three, four, five years (?) already.

Now tobacco is not, per se like shabu, a contraband.  It is only a contraband inside the jail because the jail management chose to prohibit its use by the inmates. Given the facts of the case where Fr. Darunday even surrendered the package containing the dried tobacco leaves and some packs of cigarette for inspection by the guards was already following the rules and regulations of the jail.  He cannot be imputed with the violations slapped on him because the package did not come from him or prepared by him.

The most that the guards can do is confiscate the prohibited goods and advise or even admonish Fr. Darunday not to agree to become the courier of goods for the inmates inside the jail next time.  But to slap him with a permanent ban on his ministry is a gross disrespect for the spiritual renewal that the services of Fr. Darunday brings to the inmates.

I have known Fr. Daunday for more than 10 years already.  I have yet to hear stories of him acting unpriestly.  I am very sure he would never allow himself to be used as instrument of illegal activities that could tarnish his name and reputation as a priest and that of the Catholic Church.

Fr. Darunday has been the Chaplain of the Provincial Capitol employees when I was yet with the Provincial Government of Bohol.  He was never known to avail of the perks that Chaplain is accorded because he lived a simple life that Christ wanted of His priests.

What the BDJ management should be wary about are those who allow shabu to continue to flow inside the jail courtesy of jail guards who wanted to rake in money at the expense of the war on drugs of President Rodrigo R. Duterte.  They are the very people who knowingly bring what is patently illegal and contraband goods per se into the jail premises.

But Fr. James Darunday? He is innocent of the guilt being heaped on him.  Notwithstanding the investigation currently being done on the incident, that permanent ban on him should be lifted off or rescinded.
