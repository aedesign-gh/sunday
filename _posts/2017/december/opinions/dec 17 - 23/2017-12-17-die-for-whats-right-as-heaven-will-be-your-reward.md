Special Gospel of the day (Dec. 17, 2017-Sunday) Matthew 1:18-24” Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shall call his name JESUS.
 
This gospel reminds us about the courage and bravery of Joseph to take the great responsibility as the “El Salvador” of Mary from shamefulness. Joseph protected Jesus and his wife Mary from the hands of the Assassins. This is supposedly imitated by all husbands to die for the welfare of his family. Do not give up your love ones to any one even death is the “consequence” of doing it.  Die for what is right because at the end, heaven will be your reward. God trust you so much for giving you someone under your care and protection. He expects you to love this person no matter what. He wants you to push this person for him to fulfill his divine assignments on this earth. He believes on your capacity to make a big difference to somebody else. It is not an accident for having someone in your life.
 
They are sent by God for a reason. You are responsible for their welfare and benefits. You are accountable for their better future. You are not born for yourself but for others. You are born to do something great for the sake of others. You have an assignment to produce more fruits on this earth. You are born to save the situation of others like Joseph.You are born to ensure anyone to finish his assignment. Encourage anyone to become positive by showing your supports to them. Be faithful in your assignment. Joseph was assigned to protect Jesus and Mary. You have the same assignment if you are a husband; do the same to your family. Love them the way Joseph Loved his own family. Love them by showing it in action. Love them by making their lives more colorful and meaningful. Sometimes you need to be at the back of the camera to boost someone on the camera.
