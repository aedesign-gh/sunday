“Human rights” has been in the news lately. And it is good. Even if a number of powerful people in our country had been known to have trampled on human rights, which is quite a sad story, still, it is good that we all think and talk about it.

What is meant by human rights? It is something to which you are entitled by virtue of being human. Human rights are based on the principle of respect for the individual. Their fundamental assumption is that each person is a moral and rational being who deserves to be treated with dignity. They are called human rights because they are universal.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights under the United Nations to which all countries agree lists 30 basic human rights and it is important that we all know what these are. And since they number 30, we shall present here the first 15, and the 2nd batch next time. Here they are: Every human being has the right -

1. To Be Born Free & Equal. We are all born free. We all have our own thoughts and ideas. We should all be treated in the same way.
2. To Be Free From Discrimination. These rights belong to everybody, whatever our differences.

3. To Have The Right to Life. We all have the right to life, and to live in freedom and safety. 

4. To Be Free From Slavery. Nobody has any right to make us a slave. We cannot make anyone our slave. 

5. To Be Free From Torture. Nobody has any right to hurt us or to torture us. 

6. To Have Rights No Matter Where You Go. I am a person just like you! 

7. To Be Equal Before the Law. The law is the same for everyone. It must treat us all fairly. 

8. To Have These Human Rights Protected by Law. We can all ask for the law to help us when we are not treated fairly. 

9. To Be Free From Unfair Detention. Nobody has the right to put us in prison without good reason and keep us there, or to send us away from our country. 

10. To Have The Right to Trial. If we are put on trial this should be in public. The people who try us should not let anyone tell them what to do. 

11. To Be Presumed Innocent Till Proven Guilty. Nobody should be blamed for doing something until it is proven. When people say we did a bad thing we have the right to show it is not true. 

12. To Have Privacy. Nobody should try to harm our good name. Nobody has the right to come into our home, open our letters, or bother us or our family without a good reason. 

13. To Be Free to Move. We all have the right to go where we want in our own country and to travel as we wish. 

14. To Be Free to Seek a Safe Place to Live. If we are frightened of being badly treated in our own country, we all have the right to run away to another country to be safe. 

15. To HaveA Nationality. We all have the right to belong to a country. (Source - http://www.youthforhumanrights.org)
