Last week we motored to Dimiao town to visit a friend who celebrated his birthday. After lunch my friend brought me to the side of their town church where there was an “Ermita” which was recently declared a national heritage by the National Historical Commission.

“Ermita”is a Spanish word which means a small stone building usually at the middle of the cemetery where the dead was momentarily  put prior to their burial as the grave diggers were still excavating their tomb.

Looking the “ermita” from the outside one can see of the Spanish trademark of a thick square coral stone wall. Green moss and ferns clung to the stones which some parts had collapsed apparently weakened by time. Once inside one can see the small stone niches one on top of another in four tiers which lined on the four sides of the cemetry. The dilapidated and vandalized remains of the “ermita”  lay in the middle of the area.

The Dimiao“ermita” is the only one of its kind in the entire country. There were no written records of what was the purpose for the small niches which baffled historians. Thus they declared the area as historical mystery like the statues of Easter Island in Peru.

The National Museum and the National Historical Commission do not have budget for the “ermita” preservation unlike the across the road Dimiaochuch which has a hefty budget for its renovation. If it will be keep in shape and tidy with no overgrown weeds around the “ermita” it could attract historical tourists who delight in the mystery and enigma of the place.
