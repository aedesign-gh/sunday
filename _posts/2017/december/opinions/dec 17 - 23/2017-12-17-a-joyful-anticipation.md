3rdSunday of Advent (cycle B)
Readings:	Is61:1-3, 10-11; 1 Thes5:16-24; Jn1:6-8, 19-28

The third Sunday of Advent is called Gaudete Sunday.  The day takes its common name from the Latin word Gaudete ("Rejoice"), the first word of the introit of this day's Mass:  “Gaudete in Domino semper: iterumdico, gaudete.”  This may be translated as: "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice.”

The third candle of the Advent Wreath which is being lit is colored pink.  It should be noted that the purple color of Advent is the color of penitence and fasting as well as the color of loyalty to welcome the Advent of the King.  This Sunday, there is a shift from the purple of the season to pink or rose which reflects the lessening emphasis on penitence as attention turned more to celebration of the season.  There is a kind of exciting feeling of anticipation like a child waiting for someone or something which is very significant.  This theme of joyful expectation is also reflected in our readings this Sunday.

In the second part of the first reading from the prophet Isaiah, the prophet starts to sing a song of praise to the Lord.  He is so sure of the love of God that he already starts celebrating salvation and exclaims: “I exult for joy in Yahweh, my soul rejoices in my God.  These same words will also be proclaimed by Mary in her Magnificat. Many are the reasons that make us sad, and yet, like the prophet, we can begin to sing a song of joy for the salvation that will reach out to every person.  The first reading states that happiness is a demanding task, but it is a gift that God will give to all men and women. 

The second reading speaks that the Christian is a cheerful person; he is happy since Christ has shown him the meaning of life.  Rich or poor, sick or healthy, the Christian is always happy.

The Gospel also speaks of joy in referring to John in relation with the light.  I can relate to this with my personal experience.  Once I went spelunking with some friends.  It happened that I had some muscle cramps to both of my legs and it as difficult for me to move.  Fear crept in with the thought that we might get trapped inside the cave since our lamps had almost died out.  I almost thought my end was near.  But we moved on slowly until I saw a trace of light ahead of us.  My fear was changed into joy – a joy of anticipation that the exit from the cave is near and I will be saved.

This is also the same with life.  Sometimes we get trapped in the darkness of our sinfulness.  There is a temptation to become desperate and lose hope.  This advent season is a reminder for us that everything will not end up in hopelessness.  The advent season teaches us that there is a light ahead and that means that there is salvation ahead.

John was not the light, but a witness to introduce the light.  He was like the moon that shines through the dark night.  The moon is not the source of its light for it just reflects the light of the sun.  John is the moon and Christ is the sun.  The presence of John was a sign that the real light is about to come and we anticipate with joy the coming of that light.

The Gospel teaches us that the happy persons are the ones who listens to the Baptist, because they let their mind and heart be opened, recognize the Messiah and welcome his light.
