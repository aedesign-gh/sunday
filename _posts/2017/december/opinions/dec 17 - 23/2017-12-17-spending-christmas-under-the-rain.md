As we try to beat press time, we got a weather update that another storm is on its way to the Visayas, this time, stronger than the existing Urduja.

The latest that we got is that Vinta, code name of the typhoon when it enters into the Philippine area of responsibility, is going to hit land in Mindanao and may turn into a tropical storm.

Weather forecasters claim that Vinta may cause heavy rains in the Visayas while it hits land in Mindanao later next week, Thursday and Friday.

In other words, itwill be going to be a rainy Christmas and we don’t know how it will affect the dawn masses as Catholics troop to churches.

Fortunately, we have not heard any typhoon which mars the celebration of the New Year.

In our mid-centennial existence in this world, what we’ve experience are the cold nights of December until the first week of January though time is changing nowadays.

The severity of the wet and dry season in the country brought about by the so-called Climate Change has shifted the paradigm of the weather condition in the entire country.

From the words of our mentor in journalism, the late ZoiloDejaresco, do not predict the weather because it always changes that is why originally typhoons are named after women – who always kept changing their minds.

If the forecast will be unchanged, then we will have rainy days few days before Christmas Day.
Christmas songs are not wanting about spending Christmas during rainy days like this one which is about to unfold.

The situation will likely lessen the traffic mess in downtown Tagbilaran which is now confronted by a heavy influx of people coming from the towns and those who went home to the city in time for the holiday season.

Try to go around the city these days and you will find it irritating because of the heavy flow of pedestrians and the day to day increase of cars and SUVs brought about by the low down payment because of the feared excise tax in buying cars and vehicles.

These all added to the miseries of the traffic situation were almost everybody are in a state of panic buying as if goods are running out of stock tomorrow.

But if ever the weather forecast will become through, that will be the ultimate solution to these traffic rush and the heavy influx of pedestrians in the city.

With a rainy climate, people will have second thoughts in going out of their houses and go shopping and eating outside as their cars and vehicles will become dirty to the advantage of the car wash establishments.

For those who are going straight with nine early dawn masses, they will have the ample reason for skipping their dawn masses when heavy rains break loose as the Christmas Day draws nearer.
Yehey!
