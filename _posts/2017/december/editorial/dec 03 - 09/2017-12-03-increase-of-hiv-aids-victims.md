Based on the recent report by the Department of Health (DOH), out of the four provinces in the region, Bohol ranked second in terms of the highest number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases.

According to DOH-7’s Re-Emerging Infectious Disease Program coordinator Dr. Van Baton, 153 HIV cases have been recorded in Bohol from 1984 to June of 2017 while 27 cases of the disease developed into full-blown AIDS.

This is quite an increase of the AIDS incidence in the province and thus requires a closer look by authorities. 

In the first place, there must be a socio-demographic profile of those being victimized by AIDS so that it will be the basis of the action plan of the government.

Although Cebu recorded the most number of HIV and AIDS cases with 3,665 and 219, respectively.Negros Oriental recorded 84 HIV cases and 15 AIDS cases, while Siquijor, the smallest and least populated province in the region, tallied six HIV cases in the same period.

Cebu’s high number of HIV and AIDS cases to its location as gateway from other regions to the rest of Central Visayas.

The growth in the number of cases of HIV is being attributed to unprotected sexual intercourse and sharing of needles with those who have the infection.

Most of the HIV cases in the region were recorded among those aged 15 to 24.To the uninitiated, HIV, a virus that attacks the immune system, leads to AIDS.

While the government has launched efforts to address the rising number of HIV and AIDS cases in the country, the DOH still considers HIV screening as among chief measures against the spread of the infection.

As we marked the World AIDS Day last Dec. 1, it’s about time to give the HIV/AIDS infection an utmost priority by the government. (DAB)
