Listening to the self-proclaimed "disente" crowd led by no less than the ex-president himself, you are tempted to think they should in fact be congratulated for the infamous P3.5 billion dengvaxia scandal.
Yes, there was lack, no, absence of remorse over the fate that they brought on the hapless 700,000 human beings - simply because they are the ones responsible for it.

There is no hint of a confession that they were responsible for endangering the lives of hundreds of thousands of children.

In fact, the opposite is true.

Of course, it would be too much to expect the yellow crowd to accept liability, atone for their sin and willingness to suffer the consequences of their dastardly act.

That does not come as a surprise for an administration that has shown no remorse for nearly turning the country into a narco-state, for looting Yolanda victims of the aid extended to them by foreign donors, for sending SAF policemen to their early deaths and for numerous instances of incompetence that it has inflicted on an entire generation.

Yes, it is difficult to miss the sheer hypocrisy from those who do not see anything good in President Rodrigo Duterte and his less-than-two-year-old administration.

Were it the other way around, people can just imagine how the self-righteous yellow crowd would have gone to town demanding the crucifixion of the culprits.

Just because they had the gall to call themselves "disente", they believe they are entitled to belief in their outrageous claim to good faith in this pathetic scam.

This leads us to the question: is there such a thing as good faith in consigning 700,000 lives to such life-threatening risk?

If we listen to them, that is exactly what the disentes are now actually telling us.
