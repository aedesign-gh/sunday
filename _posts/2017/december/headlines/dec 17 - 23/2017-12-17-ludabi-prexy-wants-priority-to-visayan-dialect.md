LUDABI prexy on Bisayan tongue up

The national president of the Visayan-speaking association wanted the Duterte governme.t to give priority to the Bisayan language especially in schools.

Atty. Leo M. Zaragosa, national president of the LubassaDagangBisaya (LUDABI) explained his treatise as guest of honor during the joint Awarding Rites and Christmas Party of the Association of Writers and Radio Announcers (AWRA) here last Saturday night at Reyna’s Restaurant in Cogon District this city.

The annual AWRA activity was supported by three other organizations including the Bohol Literary Arts and Culture Circle (BLACC), National Visayan Culture and Arts, Inc. (NAVISCAI) and LUDABI.

Bringing his latest edition of the LUDABI magazine, Zaragosa is making rounds all over the country by visiting LUDABI chapters to help the group resuscitate from its hibernation.
