A true-blue health buff, City Mayor John Geesnell "Baba" Yap through the City Health Office launched last weethe Fit 4 Life Hypertension and Diabetes Club. 

With almost 2,000 members led by its president, LeonidaLumantas, the club aims to advocate a healthy lifestyle by eating the right food, drinking the right medicine, doing the proper exercise and monitoring regularly. 

Only in Tagbilaran, this pioneering initiative will drumbeat the importance of having the right lifestyle in the management of hypertension and diabetes. 

Lectures will be conducted regularly to further educate its members, coupled with healthy activities to help them combat the disease. 

During the grand launch, two experts were invited to deliver and moderate the discussion on hypertension and diabetes, Dr. Stephen Lopez from the Governor CelestinoGallares Memorial Hospital (GCGMH) and Dr.Reesha May Aranas from Don Emilio Del Valle Hospital respectively.

Mayor Yap in his message stressed the importance of mindfulness saying that"prevention is always better than cure, some illness if properly managed can be cured at home, without going to the hospital and spending a lot of money‚Äù. 

He added that for this program, the city will pioneer BABA (balay to balay) where home care professionals will not only deliver the free medicines right at the members' doorsteps, but will also conduct vital signs check-up.
