A much-awaited project of supplying potable water to the tourism island of Panglao hits a snag as a supposedly ‘ministerial’issuance of an excavation permit remained unsigned at the office of the governor.
Elmer Lim, vice-president for communications of the project proponent RICHLI Corp., told the local media in a press briefing last Tuesday that the permit to excavate and install water pipes across Balilihan-Corella provincial road, is still awaiting the signature of Gov. Edgar M. Chatto.

The permit is not yet available, despite anendorsementfrom the Provincial Engineer Office (PEO) that it found “the application is in order and recommended for approval.”

The PEO endorsement for the issuance of an excavation permit was dated Oct. 5signed by Provincial Engr.Gabino. C. Redulla, and attested by Road-Right of Way in-charge Alfredo P. Cabulao.

A restoration fee amounting to P56,100 was already paid at the Provincial Treasurer’s Office. The excavation works, however, cannot proceed without the governor’s signature in the permit.

“All requirements are already complied, four contractors, instead of one, to fast track the work completion are hired and had mobilized their crew and equipment to start at any moment’s notice. Water is the long-time cry of resort owners, business establishments and residents in the island of Panglao. I cannot understand what is holding the governor to sign the excavation permit,” Lim lamented.

A check at the source site in Malingin Spring,Barangay Patrocinio, Cortestown revealed that road- right of way from private land owners were already acquired, access road opened and the municipal government is ready to sign a memorandum of agreement for the project.

SUSPICIONS

Some observers are into suspicion that “politics have reared its ugly head”, recalling the last May 2016 polls. 

In that election, a scion of the Lim family, former Loay Mayor Rosemarie “May” Lim-Imboy ran against Chatto, posting a scary score of222,222 votes against the incumbent Chatto who won with330,751 total votes.

May Imboy is the younger sister of Richard Lim, chairman of RICHLI Corp. boardof directors and chief executive officer.

“This project taps a surface spring water source which is seen to be sustainable compared to other water supply systems that drill for underground water which is salty, posing health problems of kidney, gall bladder and other internal infections. A multi-stage, high-techwater filtration unit will be installed and this will produce a quality, safe, potable water,” Elmer Lim added.

Ronaldo Pinto, project consultant,further explained that this is the most viable project that had five years of study. This surface water supply system operates more reliably and economically, and cost less compared to drawing water by underground drilling or seawater desalination process.

The water lines will use 18” HOPE pipes and will be installed at least 30 cm. below the lowest portion of the road so as to avoid destruction or damage of pipes in the course of periodic road maintenance works.
Pinto works for 25 years with the Local Water Utilities Administration and is a certified public accountant (CPA) and holds a master’s degree in business administration (MBA).

POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS

During its regular session last Thursday, the SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol, passed a resolution indorsing the bulk water supply project of RICHLI Corp.The passage of the resolution came while Gov. Chatto was outside the country.

The resolution was sponsored by Dr. Romulo CepedozaLigangmga Barangay(LnB) provincial federation representative and ex-officio board member.

Earlier, the LnB inPanglao also passed a resolution endorsing the request of RICHLI Corp. to Chatto for an excavation permit along the Balilihan-Corella provincial road.

The barangay leaders cited the island’s growing tourism industry that badly need sustainable water supply, on top of new facilities and infrastructurebuilt in the area. 

Panglao island is the site of the P7.2B New Bohol Airport nearing completion which offers facilities of international standards. The airport is expected to open June next year.

This new development raises anew the issue onthe need or an assurance for a 24/7 sustainable water supply in the island.

Tagbilaran City, through City Mayor John Geesnell ”Baba” Yap, had also manifested its interest to allow the RICHLI Corp. to expand their services in at least four districts in the city. The city is presently served by a private firm, Bohol Water Utilities Inc. (BWUI), a subsidiary of the SalconGroup of Companies. The city government also operates its own local waterworks system.

“Competition provides choices for water qualityand better distributionservices which would be beneficial to both; the business sector and the community,” excited water consumers said.

CHATTO COMMENT

Chatto, in a brief phone interview with this paper, minutes before his flight for an international speaking engagement in Jakarta, brushed aside all speculations of politics and alleged vested interest.
“It is always a welcome development when investors put interest to the pressing need of water, particularly in the tourism island of Panglao. But project like this has to undergo the required processes and everybody has to abide with it. There is no truth that I am delaying the project,” Chatto said.

The governor added that he only knew of the proposed RICHLI Corp water supply project during the full council meeting of the Provincial Development Council (PDC) held last Monday.

In the PDC meeting, the RICHLI Corp.was able to present the profile and full details of the project, which, according to them, involves an investment of about P1.5 billion.

Project contractors and suppliers, reportedly, have posed threats to the proponent of filing claims of damages if the works encounter farther delays.

The governor is expected to answer allegations and attend to the issues involving the excavation permit applied by RICHLI Corp. as he returns to work next week.
