Almost 200 city party members trooped to the Bohol Institute of Technology-International College (BIT-IC) yesterday to join the general assembly of the PartidoDemokratiko Pilipino-Lakasng Bayan (PDP-Laban).

The tarpaulin posted in the gathering indicated the two party leaders, Vice Gov. Dionisio D. Balite, whose family owns the venue of the gathering, and Dr.DoloreichDumaluan, former town mayor of Panglao and the acknowledged provincial chairman of the party.

Dumaluan arrived passed 11 o’clock in the morning while Balite was reportedly out of town whose cellular phone is out of reach, according to reports gathered by this paper.

After lecturing the party members about federalism, the city PDP-Laban members went home past 4 pm yesterday still unclear as to whom will the party acknowledged as its leader – whether Balite or Dumaluan.

Some party members interviewed by this paper claimed that it will just be depending on the agreement between the two acknowledged leaders of the political party which catapulted Rodrigo RoaDuterte into the presidency.
Balite practically did not show up during the activity yesterday despite the fact that he is the highest elective post in the province.

Dumaluan has been calling the shots of the party during the presidential and local elections in 2016 signing the certificate of nominations (CONA) for the party candidates in the local polls.

He lost during the mayoralty race in his hometown but still exercise the powers as provincial chairman of PDP-Laban in the province.

The row over the provincial leadership of the party has been the capital of the Liberal Party (LP) led by Gov. Edgar M. Chatto to hold its members from switching party affiliations to the party in power in Bohol.
Yet, Cong. Art C. Yap has already joined PDP-Laban last month and will probably lead the party in the local elections in 2019. Reports said Yap, who has made himself visible to the Boholano public recently, is eyeing the highest post in the Capitol vice Chatto who is now on his last and final term as governor.

If Cabinet Sec. Jun Evasco will do a Duterte in the 2019 local polls, he will be at the logger heads with Yap in the gubernatorial race.
