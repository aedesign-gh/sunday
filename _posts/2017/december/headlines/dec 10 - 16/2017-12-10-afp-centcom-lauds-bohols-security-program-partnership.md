AFP CentCom lauds 
security program here
 
CEBU CITY.-The Central Command (CENTCOM) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) based here lauded last week the security program partnership in Bohol.

Lt. Gen. Oscar Lactao, now retired, singled out Bohol as testament to strong security program partnership with the leadership of Gov. Edgar M. Chatto.

In his valedictory address during Change of Command and Retirement Ceremony, Lactao shared his experience in Bohol in partnership with the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the provincial government in the successful neutralization of the Abu Sayaff amid the holding of an Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting last April this year.

“Great deeds can only be done by great people who are working together.” Lactao said.

Chatto attended the time-honored military tradition held at the CENTCOM headquarters held in Cebu laast Friday, where Lactao relinquished his post to new CENTCOM commander,  MajorGen Paul Atal with Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero, AFP chief of staff as presiding officer and guest of honor.

Guerrero, in his speech, congratulated Lactao for his successful stint as CENTCOM commander, also highlighting the strong partnership program in Bohol.

Lactao received a command plaque, plaque of honorable service, encased Philippine Flag and medal frame for his 37 years of service.

Atal, who served as an assistant division commander when Lactao was the division commander of the 4th Infantry Diamond Division, said he still has big boots to fill as he assumed the post.

He vowed to continue coordinating with local governments to secure the Visayas region from any threat, focusing on suppressing insurgency in Central Visayas.

Atal stated he will continue supporting the police and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in the war on illegal drugs.

He will also prioritize keeping a consistent line of communication with the regional and local officials for them to be updated with AFP campaign plans as well as conducting capability enhancement programs for soldiers.
