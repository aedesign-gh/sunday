Board Member Jade Acapulco Bautista (3rd district) of the SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol issued an appeal last week to all to unite and prevent the spread of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV.

Bautista, who chairs the health committee of the SangguniangPanlalawigan, expressed deep concern over the extent of the disease following the somewhat alarming report that Central Visayas is among the top areas with a lot of people are affected by the disease.

More and more AIDS-affected people total to 1,113 and HIV-affected, 9,264 from Jan. to Dec 2016, report cited by Bautista showed.

Some 26 people are diagnosed per day with the disease and nine out of 10 are said to be “asymptomatic;” 63 women are living with HIV are pregnant, it said.

There are 22 people aged between 15-24 are affected; aged 25-34, 2,625; 35-49, 1,510; and 50-above, 186.

The monthly number of HIV-positive cases in the Philippines hit a record high since 1984 to 1,098 new cases, mostly among young males in May 2017, the Department of Health (DOH) said as quoted by CNnPhiippines. "This was 48 percent higher as compared with the same reporting period last year and also the highest recorded cases ever since 1984," the DOH's HIV/AIDS and ART Registry said in a statement on July 24. The DOH recorded 741 cases in May 2016.

The DOH has been recording cases of HIV/AIDS in the Philippines since January 1984. To date, it has tallied  44,010 cases of Filipinos with HIV/AIDS. In 2017, the number of HIV/AIDS cases rose by 15 percent to 4,388 from January to May compared to the same period a year ago.

“HIV/AIDS is among the communicable diseases the Duterte administration has vowed to control in its Philippine Health Agenda plan for 2016-2022 spearheaded by the DOH. In its latest report for May 2017, the DOH said more than half of the cases or 554 were from the 25-34 year age group while 30 percent or 325 cases were of youth aged 15-24 years, it said. The National Capital Region reported the most number of cases at 404.”

AIDS “is the appearance of clinical manifestation of HIV infection. In this state, the person presents with opportunistic infections of unlimited extents and possibilities. They also present with atypical presentation and severity. Person with AIDS is very infectious, they are very ill and also prone to aggressive kinds of cancer.”

HIV is a viral infection that attacks and slowly destroys the immune system of the infected person that leads to “immune deficiency”. It is progressive and can lead to lack of body defense to all kinds of infection including those that don’t normally infect man and can also lead to cancer susceptibility.”

Bautista has endorsed DOH’s programs with regard to the prevention and fight against stigma and discrimination, strategies and interventions: (a) Availability of free voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing Service; (b) 100% Condom Use Program (CUP) especially for entertainment establishments; (c) Peer education and outreach; (d) Multi-sectoral coordination through Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC); (e) Empowerment of communities; (f) Community assemblies and for a to reduce stigma; (g) Augmentation of resources of social Hygiene Clinics; and (h) Procured male condoms distributed as education materials during outreach.
