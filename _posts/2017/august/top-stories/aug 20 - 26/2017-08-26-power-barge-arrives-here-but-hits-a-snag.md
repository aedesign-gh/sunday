PRES. GARCIA – The much-expected arrival of the power barge owned and operated by SPC Corp. finally came last week but was temporarily dock at Baud-Lawis here due to some hitches.

Meaning, it could not yet start its operation as scheduled.

Reports said the power vessel could not drop anchor in Tapal port in Ubay due to the difficulty in passing the narrow channel and avoid its pole from contacting with the hanging live wires.   

The power barge has been four for two days now, according to reports reaching the Bohol Sunday News.

It cannot just sail towards Tapal port for berthing due to difficulty in maneuvering its pole not to keep contact with the hanging live wires traversing the narrow channel dividing Pres. CPG and Ubay through power towers managed by National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), a source said.

But an official of the NGCP, who made an ocular visit in Tapal port a day after the barge arrived, said that live wires hanging between to giant towers are higher (about 30 meters, more or less) than the power barge’s pole of about 23-25 meters.

Earlier, the in-charge of the barge decided to cut a few meters of the barge’s pole by using the chainsaw but the chainsaw operators can hardly cut it off, the source said.

It was expected yesterday that the power barge has already negotiated in berthing the wharf.

The power barge with a capacity of about 32 megawatts (MW) is very much needed. It will be temporarily moored here but will be transferred to Catagbacan port in Loon town after the distribution power lines are completed.

The province is still suffering from rotational brownouts despite the additional supply from Cebu following the total blackout that hit Bohol early last month.
The provincial government wanted to have its own generating capacity or island based power generating to cushion the impact of blackouts that are more on distribution-related rather than supply-related. 

“The power generation projects using appropriate technologies in suitable areas of the province include formulation of a long-term Bohol Island Power Development Plan (BIPDP) to ensure security of supply–-available when needed; reliability and resiliency (climate-proof) of supply; and affordability (least-cost),” Capitol report said.

The Provincial Planning and Development Office (PPDO) earlier said that Bohol relies mainly on its power supply from Leyte geothermal interconnection with “dependable capacity” of106.2 MW and 110MW as “installed capacity.”

Bohol is being powered by island based power generating plants: former Bohol Diesel Power Plant but currently run by Southern Island Power Corp with installed power of 22 MW and dependable 17.5MW; former Loboc Hydro plant now run by Santa Clara Corp, 1.2MW and 1.2 MW; Hanopol hydro plant, 5MW for “installed” and “dependable;” and Sevilla MinI-hydro managed by BOHECO I, 2.5MW for both capacities.

PPDO said that the net reserve of the power supply is about 58.2MW and the forecast demand would be 48MW. (rvo)
