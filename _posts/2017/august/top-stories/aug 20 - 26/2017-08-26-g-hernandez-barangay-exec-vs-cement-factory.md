GARCIA-HERNANDEZ.- A punong barangay in this town expressed apprehensions over the week over the planned cement factory over the ricefields in  Barangays Manaba and West Canayaon.

Punong Barangay Favio C. Jamero of East Canayaon here voiced his worry and wary over the planned cement factory by a company that is also running a cement factory in Cebu.

In his letter dated Aug. 15 to Vice-Mayor Lito O. Dajalos, Jamero said he only learned of the project when Kagawad Edwin Baja made mention of the cement factory during the recent meeting of the Liga ng mga Barangay.

He said he is very much concerned over land conversion wherein rice farms have to be converted into a cement factory.

In his two-page letter, Jamero said cement factory is good, but why out of it, in a primary agricultural land that is regularly producing and is the main source of our staple food. 

“This rice field is so important that it embeds the story of people living in this area. Destroying it is like destroying a particular cultural heritage”, Jamero pointed out.

Jamero said is cement factory more important than food and cultural heritage.

He also said that wiping out rice farms for the sake of cement factory runs counter to national food sufficiency program that the national government is trying to improve food production.

“I am not against industrialization. I am not against cement factory to be established in our municipality, however, it is should be established, put it somewhere else not in the primary agricultural land”, Jamero emphasized.

He said that he is certain that there are other areas that could accommodate the project.

Jamero also wanted to know if the travel of the town officials to Japan part of the planning process regarding the cement factory.

Reliable source (name withheld) said that some town officials went to Japan where the Taiheiyo company is also operating a cement factory with all expenses bankrolled by the said company. 

The purpose was to get first-hand information how a cement plant operates, the source said.

Jamero wondered why they are so silent about this matter when in fact this is of great interest to the people.

If realized, Jamero said, the factory will drastically change the physical, socio-cultural and economic environment of the town.

When sought for comment, Vice-Mayor Dajalos declined.

Some barangay officials of Manaba and West Canayaon refused to say something about it. A barangay official, who asked anonymity, said he won’t give his piece until after the feasibility study is presented.

FB account user Linda Paredes said “GH should think about this more seriously. This is a serious concern to our environment. Rice fields take priority over a cement factory. We cannot create rice fields. They are nature's gifts; God-given. Irreplaceable.”

Fr. Roque P. Vano posted that  “ecotourist Bohol has no place for a cement factory. Send also that limestone mining out of Bohol.”(rvo)
