The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Aug. 27, 2017- Sunday) John 2:13-25” What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?" Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Jews then said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?" But He was speaking of the temple of His body. So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken. Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing. But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men, and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.

Getting angry actually is not a sin as long as, you know how to handle this and put this in an exact situation. It was done by Jesus inside at the temple because he witnessed the wrong doings of the leaders and the Pharisees. Ephesians 4:26”BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger. Take note, Jesus has the right to get angry but we have no right to do that because once and for all, we have also lapses and mistakes. Jesus cleansed the physical temple which reminds us to preserve the sacredness of it. You need to maintain the holiness of the place of God for worship. Are you helping your respective church? What have you done for the maintenance of your churches?

On the other hand, another temple to be preserved is our individual body. We are the individual temple of God. 1 Corinthians 3:16”Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? Put in your mind that doing wrong towards oneself is a mortal sin since this is the spiritual dwelling place of God on this earth. 1 Corinthians 3:17”If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are. Be careful for what you have eaten because it will destroy the holy place of God. Remain healthy.
