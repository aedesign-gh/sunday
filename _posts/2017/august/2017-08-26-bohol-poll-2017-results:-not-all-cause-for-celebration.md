We congratulate the leading officials of Bohol for their excellent and some for their very good voters’ satisfaction rating in the recent Bohol Poll conducted by the Holy Name University (HNU) using the Social Weather Station methodology from June 10 to July 20, 2017. Nobody got lower than “very good” rating. Polled for voters’ satisfaction were the President and Vice President, the congressmen of the three (3) districts of Bohol, the governor, vice governor, city mayor and vice mayor of Tagbilaran City, the PNP and the military.

Polls or surveys of this sort provide public officials with their public service scorecard as perceived by the citizenry, in this case the voters of Bohol.  While the respondents of 400 are only samples of the opinions, perceptions and experiences of the people, the survey is scientifically conducted and the results are therefore statistically valid.

The poll results for voters satisfaction with a net rating in descending order are as follows: City Mayor Baba Yap + 98%, up by 6 percentage points from last year’s polls; President Rodrigo Duterte + 88%; Gov. Edgar M. Chatto +85%, up by four (4) points from last year; Congressman Aris Aumentado of the 2nd District +84%, up by 15 points from last year; City Vice Mayor Toto Veloso +79%, down by four (4) points from last year; Cong. Arthur Yap of the 3rd District +74%, up by 11 points from last year; Vice Governor Dioning Balite +70%; Cong. Rene Relampagos of the 1st District +54%, up by four (4) points from last year; and Vice President Leni Robredo +53%. Ratings of +70% and higher are considered excellent satisfaction rating while ratings +69% down to 50% are considered very good. It should be noted that Cong. Aumentado got the highest increase in satisfaction rating of 15 points.

On first glance, everyone should be celebrating for their excellent and very good satisfaction scorecard rating.  But that celebration could be short-lived once you look at the other results of the polls.  Let’s look at the self-rated poverty threshold.  Almost six (6) out of 10 Boholanos or 58% said they were poor, while only 6% said they were not. The remaining 36% said they were just on the line, whatever that means.  Granting there are only 1.3 million Boholanos now, that is 754,000 Boholanos who are poor.  Where is now the vaunted program to reduce poverty reduction to 25% by 2020, or is it 2015%?

According to the respondents who said they were poor, they would need at least Php15,000 monthly income to be out of the poverty threshold.  I think this is almost the same poverty threshold of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the national planning body.

Again let’s look at the unemployment rate.  Unemployment here is defined as not working but is looking for work. Unemployment therefore is not something that they have chosen.  Under this situation are 10% or 130,000 Boholanos who are looking for work but could not find one here in Bohol.  This figure is 1% point higher than the 9% unemployed as of April last year.

As to the most important problem in the locality, 48% identified economic as the most pressing – these are unemployment, financial, livelihood, and the high cost and scarcity of food. This is not the first time that we hear of high cost of food in Bohol. Tourists who have been to other destinations in the country point to Bohol has the most expensive when we talk of food.  Compounding this is that some 61% have yet to have access to running water in their homes.  This could explain the water-borne diseases suffered by patients seeking treatments in our hospitals.

And then again, for decades now the advocacy for women empowerment has been there.  Yet 51% of Boholano voters still agree that women are only good in the care of the family and other church activities. Culture and traditions are really difficult to change and it cannot be done overnight.  One consolation is that this figure is four (4) points less than last year’s 55%.

Now what does this poll results tell our politicians and development planners? I would venture to say “not less than a truckload.”  May be there is less consultations with the people in coming up with our development plans notwithstanding the mandatory provision of the Local Government Code of 1991 to include the private sector in local governance especially development planning. Or perhaps bottom-up planning as a strategy for development has not really been put good practice.

One thing is for sure, the results of the HNU Poll 2017 is still a cause for review of the development directions and priorities that we are taking, if not a wake-up call to some. Let us be happy, though, that 72% of the Boholano voters still say that there is hope for Bohol and that there is no need to get out of the province.

Lastly we congratulate the PNP for having a +70 (excellent) net rating in their efforts to fight illegal drugs in the province.  This is an increase of 52 percentage points from last year’s 18%. The military got a +87% net for stopping the entry of the Abu Sayyaf in Bohol early this year.
