Photo above shows two passenger buses including a Fatima Trans followed by a Southern Star falling into a road canal in Barangay Buenavista, Carmen town last Friday. Apparently, the two passenger vehicles were allegedly racing each other making the road narrower. No one was reported injured in the road mishap.
