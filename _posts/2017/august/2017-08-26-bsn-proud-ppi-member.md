Frankly speaking, this paper is still a cinch away from achieving the regular membership in the most prestigious Philippine Press Institute (PPI), the national association of Philippine newspapers.

Last May, the Bohol Sunday News (BSN) was conferred with a probationary membership by PPI during its 50th National Press Forum held at the H2O Hotel in Manila.

Executive Director Ariel C. Sebellino and PPI Chair Alfonso G. Pedroche signed the Probationary Membership Certification of this paper which was personally received by yours truly during the opening rites of the press forum.

However, despite being a probationary member, this paper has already been included in the updated list of members posted by the PPI on its website.

No one can be happier than us seeing the BSN’s masthead in the array of the Bohol Chronicle and the Bohol Times. But not all the local weekly newspapers in Bohol are there.

The inclusion of this paper as among the country’s weekly newspapers introduced us as to how other community and other daily regional newspapers in the country operate.

It also gave us the opportunity to rub elbows with other media personalities all over the country and learn from their experiences.

While our PPI membership gave us the more strength and the passion to be more effective in the fourth estate, we are also saddened to have replaced the righteous place of the defunct Bohol Sunday Post and the late editor-publisher Boy Guingguing in the PPI.

So that when we have the chance to browse over the Internet lately, we spotted the PPI website and searched its list of members from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao and finding therein the masthead of this paper and our name.

While we are still re-constructing our new website, our Facebook fan page of the BSN serves as our online connection. In the next few days, we will be having our new website at www.boholsundaynews.com.ph for our online readers to follow.

Our PPI membership is not the end of our journey in the journalistic world. We have to level up and join the competition in the Internet which is now the battlefield among newspapers.

But one thing for sure, the membership of the this paper with the PPI is one proof that the BSN has finally arrived. Take it or leave it.
