21st Sunday of the Year (cycle A)
Readings:	Is 22:19-23; Rom 11:33-36; Mt 16:13-20

One time I was able to attend the turn over ceremony of the newly renovated school in our village.  Before the turn over ceremony we celebrated the Holy Eucharist first. Part of the ceremony is the passing of the symbolic key of the school to the principal teacher.  This scene reminds me of our readings today.

In the first reading which was taken from the book of Isaiah we heard how Eliakim was awarded with the office of the prime minister.  Part of the ceremony was the placing (by the king) on the shoulders of the new prime minister the key of the king’s palace.  Why on the shoulders and not on the hands?  Because in ancient times the keys were very large and heavy and had to be carried on the shoulders.

To receive the keys meant to have full power in the palace of the king, authority to administer his property and to decide who was to be received and who should be kept out in the palace.

In our Gospel today, we are told that after Peter professed his faith to the Lord, Jesus gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Peter, that is, conferred on him full power.

Going back to the first reading, Isaiah describes Eliakim, who will have the key of the house of David on his shoulder, and who alone will open and shut. Now the duty of Eliakim was to be the faithful steward of the house. It is the steward who carries the keys of the house, who in the morning opens the door, and in the evening shuts it, and through whom visitors gain access to the royal presence. So then what Jesus is saying to Peter is that in the days to come, he will be the steward of the Kingdom. And in the case of Peter the whole idea is that of opening, not shutting, the door of the Kingdom.

That came abundantly true. At Pentecost, Peter opened the door to three thousand souls (Acts 2:41). He opened the door to the Gentile centurion Cornelius, so that it was swinging on its hinges to admit the great Gentile world (Acts 10:1-48 ). Acts 15:1-41 tells how the Council of Jerusalem opened wide the door for the Gentiles, and how it was Peter's witness which made that possible (Acts 15:14; Simeon is Peter). The promise that Peter would have the keys to the Kingdom was the promise that Peter would be the means of opening the door to God for thousands upon thousands of people in the days to come. But it is not only Peter who has the keys of the Kingdom; every Christian has; for it is open to every one of us to open the door of the Kingdom to some other and so to enter into the great promise of Christ.

The privilege of the keys meant that Peter would be the steward of the household of God, opening the door for men to enter into the Kingdom. The duty of binding and loosing meant that Peter would have to take decisions about the Church's life and practice which would have the most far-reaching consequences. And indeed, when we read the early chapters of Acts, we see that in Jerusalem that is precisely what Peter did.

If you are aboard an airplane and you happen to fly over St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, you will see that the top view design of the basilica is that of a key.  This is a reminder that the Church is always open for all and that all are welcome in the Church.  This is the universality, or shall we say, the Catholicity of the Church.
