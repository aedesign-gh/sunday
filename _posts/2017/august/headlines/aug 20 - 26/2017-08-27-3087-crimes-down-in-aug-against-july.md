Bohol police note a 30.87% decrease in crime incidence here, at a time when brown-outs and power rationing threatened the province's security.

P/Sr. Insp. Raymond Halasan, acting operations officer of Camp Dagohoy, however subtly hinted that the crime incidence might go a bit higher in the remaining nine days of the month.

Presenting a comparative crime volume for the last three months at the joint meeting of the Provincial Peace and Order Council (PPOC) and the Provincial Anti-Drug Abuse Council (PADAC), Halasan, who used to sit as the Police Community Relations Officer following colorful stints as chief of police in Bohol stations, showed the 62 crime cases less in Bohol in July when compared to June.

June had 700 cases, while the succeeding month only had 638 cases, Inspector Halasan pointed out.
When the June and July crime difference posted an 8.86% dip, the month of August proved to be the best the police yet has to outdo.

Over-all crimes reported in Bohol for the first 22 days in August only totaled 441 cases, according to Halasan citing Camp Dagohoy's crime statistics tracking team.
As to crime classification, Bohol has 133 index and 308 non index crimes for August.
This, Halasan said, is 34 % less than the 203 index crime in July and 29.29% less non index crimes for the same month.

Also noteworthy, even as the police still has to get to it, physical injuries still top among index crimes against persons in the last three months, data from the Halasan presentation showed.

While consistently bringing down physical injury cases in the last three months from 68 in June to 56 in July and 38 in the first 22 days of August, police still need to come up with more proactive solutions, observers and council members agree.

As August had 38 physical injury cases, the month also has seven rape cases, four murder cases and one homicide case, Camp Dagohoy operations chief said.
And as to index crimes against properties, police are still battling against robbery, theft and carnapping, police said. 

Of the 308 non-index crimes during the month, Camp Dagohoy notes that 131 of these are traffic related incidents (TRI), 81 are violations of other non index crimes and 86 are special law violations.

Both average monthly crime rate (AMCR) and average monthly index crime rates (AMCIR) show reduced trends: AMCR at 51.36 in June, 46.81 in July and 32.36 in August; while the AMCIR shows June with 17.02, July at 14.89 and August at 9.76.

Also, of the crimes in August, Camp Dagohoy reports showed the police force posting a 49% crime solution efficiency, solving 208 of the 441 cases, Inspector Halasan showed.

This is slightly lower than the 69% or the 60% they posted for crimes in June and July.

By crimes solved, police means they have identified the perpetrators and file the appropriate cases in court.

Police however posted a much better crime clearance efficiency disposing and clearing 61% of the 441 cases with 271 cases considered cleared with suspects identified but still at large. (rahc/PIA-7/Bohol)
