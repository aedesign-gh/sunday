It appears to be a double whammy for Cong. Art C. Yap this month as he was charged twice by the Ombudsman in connection with the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) pork mess.

After posting a P300T bail bond early last week, the Office of the Ombudsman has again charged Yap before the Sandiganbayan for the alleged misuse of pork barrel funds when he was agriculture secretary.

This time, Yap was charged in connection with the alleged misuse of former Nueva Ecija 4th Dist. Rep. Rodolfo Antonino’s P14.55-million allocation on an alleged “ghost” livelihood project in 2007.
Two counts each of violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (which prohibits officials from causing undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted benefits to private parties) and malversation of public funds were filed on Aug. 22.

Yap had just posted a P300,000 bail on Wednesday for the unrelated case of the misuse of former Misamis Occidental 1st Dist. Rep. Marina Clarete’s P7.76-million PDAF proceeds in 2009.

FLIP FLOPPING

For his part, Yap hit the flip flopping stance of the Ombudsman on the PDAF cases.

Yap pointed out that in a similar PDAF case involving another congressman, he was declared innocent by the Ombudsman.

Last week, the Ombudsman filed charges against former Misamis Occidental Rep. Marina Clarete and 31 others, including Rep Yap, at the Sandiganbayan for their alleged involvement with seven ghost projects allegedly “allowing dubious foundations to pocket P62.63 million  in PDAF funds as stated in a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer. 

Yap was implicated in one of the seven projects and named co-accused with two counts of graft, and one each for malversation, and malversation through falsification- -accusations which he denied.

“The Ombudsman wants me held liable for a PDAF case of a legislator even if they have found me innocent in two very similar PDAF cases. They found me innocent because I never transferred a single centavo of PDAF to any NGO. Why the sudden change in their position I do not know.”

This sole act, done in 2009 during his term as agriculture secretary, was previously ruled by the Ombudsman in two other PDAF cases as legal, found him innocent, and acquitted Yap in both cases.
Dismayed by this sudden flip flopping of the Ombudsman’s decision despite the similarity of facts involving these cases, Yap has filed the appropriate motion in the Sandiganbayan to dismiss the case for lack of probable cause.

Upon an examination of the complaint filed by the Ombudsman, it seems apparent that Yap is being implicated solely by the reason of his act of representing the DA in executing the DA-NABCOR0MOA and, NABCOR. Apart from such single act, no other act is attributed to him in relation to the disbursement and utilization of Clarete’s PDAF allocation.

“What illegal act did I commit? I merely transferred the legislator’s PDAF to another government agency attached to DA. I never transacted any PDAF with any NGO. I acted within the law and cannot be held liable as I was also previously not held liable,” he added.

THE NEW CASE

In the said case, he was charged on Aug. 8 with two counts of graft, one of malversation, and one of the complex crime of malversation through falsification.

Just like in Antonino’s case, Yap was faulted for signing a MOA with Nabcor for a livelihood project which turned out not to have been implemented by the partner non-government organization Kabuhayan at Kalusugang Alay sa Masa Foundation, Inc. 

State prosecutors alleged Antonino unilaterally endorsed Buhay Mo Mahal Ko Foundation, Inc. (BMMKFI) as project partner for the distribution of livelihood technology kits funded by his Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) proceeds.

The selection of BMMKFI was allegedly done without the benefit of public bidding as required by the Government Procurement Reform Act.The non-government organization was also allegedly unaccredited and unqualified to take on the project.

Still, the National Agribusiness Corp. (Nabcor), a now-defunct state corporation, entered into a memorandum of agreement with BMMKFI representative Marilou Antonio.

BY JUST SIGNING THE MOA

As Department of Agriculture secretary then, Yap also entered into a separate MOA with Nabcor president Alan Javellana for the purported implementation of the PDAF-funded project.

Javellana and three other Nabcor officials—Rhodora Mendoza, Encarnita-Cristina Potian Munsod and Maria Ninez Guañizo—were faulted for processing and releasing the funds in two tranches of P13.095 million and P1.455 million, without checking BMMKFI’s qualifications.

This was also despite the NGO’s alleged failure to submit the project proposal required under the MOA.
For her part, BMMKFI’s Antonio issued a receipt to Nabcor for the allegedly fictitious procurement of 7,275 sets of livelihood technology kits from Carmelita Barredo of C.C. Barredo Enterprises.

After Barredo issued the receipt for the livelihood kits, Antonino himself allegedly acknowledged the delivery in a certificate of acceptance to “conceal the fictitious nature of the transaction.”

The said actions “allowed Antonio, through BMMKFI, to take possession of and thus misappropriate said PDAF-drawn public funds, instead of implementing the PDAF-funded project.”

The prosecution recommended that bail be set at a total of P140,000 for the four charges or a total of P560,000, (with reports from Inquirer.net)
