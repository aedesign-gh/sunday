The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) in Bohol hosted last week a meeting of landowners apparently to address questions on land distribution and acquisition as well as thresh out conflict between the owner and beneficiary, a decades old dilemma still facing the agency.

But in Bohol, where there’s not much landholdings in conflict, land distribution and acquisition are almost complete with some 42,000 hectares or 98%, DAR Provincial Director Grace Fua told the owners. See related story in Page 2.

Aside from resolving land-related cases, DAR also provides support services and other forms of farm assistance or infrastructure like farm-to-market road and capacity building, Fua said.

The meeting also tackled the role of Land bank of the Philippines (LBP) and overview on claims and compensation by Atty. Peter V. Canoso. He also explained the important points and nature of the bank’s bonds and investment opportunities for landowners prior to question and answer portion.

Provincial Treasurer Eustaquio Socorin talked about issues relative to tax payments for areas left after CARP coverage and provincial assessor Edgardo Orig in issuance of the tax declaration and documents required after CARP.

Register of Deeds represented by Atty. Carmelo Echica on issuance of title and when to register title/part left and documents required during the program emceed by Dr. Ronald Pumatong.

DAR Sec. Rafael Mariano recently signed Administrative Order No. 05, series 2017, “which gives way to the Land Acquisition and Distribution (LAD) process and farmer installation despite applications for conversion involving agricultural lands or pending acquisition proceedings.” The Administrative Order is retroactive and shall cover all pending agrarian law implementation cases filed before DAR, Mariano said.

“Following big agrarian reform cases such as those of the Hacienda Luisita and Lapanday Foods Inc., Mariano said that one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the agrarian law implementation is the installation of farmers on lands where there are pending cases of conversion and protest on coverage.”
The report said that “Mariano said that there must be “actual physical possession and full control of land by the farmer” before any application for conversion and protest of coverage shall be decided upon by DAR.” (rvo)
