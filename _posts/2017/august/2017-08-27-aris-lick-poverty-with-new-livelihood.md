REP. Erico Aristotle Aumentado (Bohol, 2nd District) takes seriously the “teaching a man to fish” part of the saying rather than the “giving a man a fish” part.

He says “teaching” gives a man independence through skills he learns from training – and empowers him to provide for his family.

On the other hand, “giving” merely turns such a man into a mendicant, and in the process, robs him of dignity.

His efforts at teaching skills have earned Aumentado the National Kabalikat Award from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).

TESDA recently celebrated its 23rd anniversary during which it conferred awards to partners in attaining its goals.

Aumentado had tapped the rich pool of TESDA trainors in different fields to train his constituents, hence the award given at the TESDA Auditorium, at the TESDA Complex, in Taguig City, Metro Manila.

The solon said TESDA cited him as legislative partner in promoting manpower and skills development for his constituents, especially those who cannot afford to pay for higher education.

Through these years, Aumentado’s office has been, and continuously is being a partner in the development of the Boholano workforce.

TESDA Central Office statistics show that Aumentado’s office – always ready to be of service to the public – had benefitted 8,168 Boholanos who availed of the trainings and scholarship programs from 2014-2016.
He has 5,173 assessed and 5,597 graduates employed. His office also invested P 25,473,141.41 for Technical-Vocational Education and Training (TVET).

TVET is the education or training process that, in addition to general education, involves the study of technologies and related sciences and acquisition of practical skills relating to occupations in various sectors of economic life and social life. It comprises of formal (organized programs as part of the school system) and non-formal (organized classes outside the school system) approaches.
