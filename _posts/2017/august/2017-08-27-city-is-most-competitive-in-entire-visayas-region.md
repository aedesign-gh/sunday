The CMCI ranking is spearheaded by the Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce of Makati and USAID. 

The index aims to gauge the competitiveness of local government units which would serve as a guide to potential investors where to locate their enterprises. It also serves as a roadmap to LGUs to look closely at the indicators and eventually work on areas where it needs improvement.

Rene Relampagos, the Bohol media, Bohol Chamber of Commerce Inc., (BCCI) national government agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, people’s organizations, private corporations, and to all of Tagbilaran City’s internal and external stakeholders. 

“This is a result of the synergy among theTagbilaranons supporting and trusting the city government. Also, the partnership we have gained through the years from the various sectors, whether public or private, has definitely given our governance its much-needed boost. The guidance and blessings of the Almighty in our journey have also been tremendous. This is indeed a team effort. We couldn’t have reached this far without their support,” Mayor Yap stressed.
