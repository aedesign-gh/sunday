It’s not yet 100%, but there is light in our province. It is not total darkness. Thanks be to God, and the hands that He used to work on this, such as government officials, heads of agencies,  business sector and civil society stakeholders.

As with anything in life, we can look at it half-full or half-empty. You can be a pessimist or one who looks at life in a negative way. Or, you can be an optimist, and look at life positively. For us, we would like to thank all those who contributed their share of the over-all efforts for us to continue to have light in the midst of darkness. If there was no light, we could not have written this piece in the first place.

The darkest places in Bohol are actually not the homes and streets which are yet unlighted. The darkest places in Bohol are in those minds that continue to simply criticize without offering anything constructive. We have said this before, and we say it once more, that criticism could be helpful if it offers doable solutions, and not just try to destroy the name of others.

In our readings this week, we were amazed at how our Lord Jesus Christ spoke quite directly about these things. These are His words we are quoting from Matthew 12: 34-37, “When the mouth speaks, it reveals what is in the heart. A good man distributes goodness out of the good treasure. An evil man distributes evil out of the evil treasure. I tell you that on the great day of decision, human beings will have to give account of every loveless word which they have spoken. Your share of the true Being will be according to your words; your share of the transitory world will be according to your words”. Or, in other parts of the Bible, He said: “What you sow, that you shall reap”.

Let there be light in our minds. Let there be positive thoughts in the midst of so much negativity, especially on social media. It is good to point out the wrongs in our society. But it is not enough. We must do our share on the side of the right to strike a balance. After all, isn’t that actually how light is produced, by striking a balance between the negative and positive charges of electricity? So mote it be.
