First time in the history of the Bohol Poll of the Holy Name University (HNU) here,  an elected official garnered an almost perfect score in its annual survey. 

An overwhelming majority of 99% were satisfied with the performance of City Mayor John Geesnell "Baba" Yap and only 1% said otherwise. 

This resulted to an excellent net satisfaction rating of +98. 

Also, the Tagbilaran City government dramatically increased its ratings from last year. 

Investment promotions got +76 this year, compared to only +59 last year. Livelihood and employment generation was +42 last year and became +67 this year, Environmental protection was +49 last year and soared at +79 this year. 

The survey period was from June 10-July 20 with 100 respondents from Tagbilaran City and each congressional district. 

The city treasurer and the city assessor offices were also cited as two of the best government offices in the entire province. 

Yap, a staunch believer of transparency and accountability in governance, has steadily gained momentum in his term upon his implementation of relevant initiatives which directly enhanced the life of the Tagbilaranons. 

Prominent of which were the rationalized road repair and concreting, streamlined operations in the city treasurer, city assessor and city economic enterprises offices which resulted to a dramatic increase in revenues. 

This paved the way to an increased allocation in the Special Education Fund (SEF), greatly benefitting Tagbilaran Cityâ€™s public schools. 

Mayor Yap is grateful to the unwavering commitment and support of the Tagbilaranons. 

The HNU Bohol Poll is an annual monitoring activity on the sentiments of the Boholanos on social, economic and political issues of local and national concerns.
