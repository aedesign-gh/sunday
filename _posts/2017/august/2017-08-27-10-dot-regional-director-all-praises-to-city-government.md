The newly appointed regional director of the Department of Tourism (DOT) in Region 7, Joshur Judd Lanete II, was all praises of the city government for its implementation of the its tourism compliance certificate.

Lanete personally relayed his praise during his courtesy call at the office of City Mayor Baba Yap. 
The DOT’s top honcho was in the province last week to lead the “Forum in the International Year for Sustainable Tourism Development” in Panglao. 

During the brief meeting, Lanete congratulated Mayor Yap and the City Tourism Officer, ShobelLigalig, for the successful implementation of the City Tourism Compliance Certificate (CTCC). 
The CTCC which has become one of the requirements in securing a business permit through a City Ordinance has become an effective measure for accommodation establishments to comply with the standards set by the DOT. 

As soon as the establishment becomes DOT-accredited, it automatically upscale its services parallel with the mandated requirements resulting to an improved service delivery to its clients. Aside from the improvement of the services, 

Lanete said that the compliance certificate would enable them to secure updated data from these establishments. These data would reveal tourists’ preferences, thereby creating a concrete picture of where the LGU can position itself in terms of its tourism services. 

To date, out of the ten major destinations in Region 7, Tagbilaran City ranks 4th with 230,705 local and foreign tourists’ arrivals in 2016, followed by Mandaue, Bogo, Bayawan, Canlaon, Bais and Toledo City. 

Lanete also firmed up his commitment and support to the Bohol Friendship Park and the Heritage Tour of Tagbilaran City. 

Lanete is optimistic of its potential to attract tourists in the city.

“Just like in other countries where they leverage on their natural and cultural assets.Tagbilaran City could also do the same. Aside from generating income, it would also strengthen its cultural consciousness from among the people and visitors alike”, Lanete pointed out.
Mayor Yap also showed a 3D presentation of the upcoming Information and Visitor Center in Tagbilaran City. 

The center would be a haven for tourists who wants to get information and relaxation at the same time. 

It will offer a glimpse of what Tagbilaran City has to offer, with a gallery showcasing the city’s history, a lounge with an internet connection and a shower room. United Architects of the Philippines-Bohol Chapter President, Arch. German Janus “Niňo” Guidaben designed the structure. (City Media Bureau)
