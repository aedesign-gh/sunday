ANALYSIS

Bohol incumbents:
The spouse card
(Second of a series)

TAGBILARAN CITY – One option available for contemporary politicians who are serving the final terms in office is to anoint a successor within the family. More often than not, it is the spouse card.

Let me be clear that this is not a brief for or against the spouse card. It is merely a statement of facts.
In the case of Gov. Edgardo Chatto, this is no longer a secret.

Mayor PurezaVelosoChatto is on her second term as local executive of the town of Balilihan, the Chattos’ bailiwick. A nurse, she herself comes from a politically active clan that includes incumbent Tagbilaran City Vice Mayor Jose Antonio Veloso.

The Veloso matriarch, Dr.PrimitivaSalera-Veloso, who served as vice-president of the then Divine Word College-Tagbilaran (now Holy Name University), was once councilor of Tagbilaran City.

With Gov. Chatto’s graduation, Mayor Veloso-Chatto can either run for representative of the first district (in the unlikely event that Gov. Chatto would prefer to run in Balilihan), vice-governor or even governor. 

As two-term mayor, nobody can dispute her experience as a local executive that can serve her well as representative, vice-governor or even governor.

Add to that her experience as a staff of the governor’s late father, former Assemblyman EladioChatto as well as her political pedigree and you have one who has enough political sense to aspire for any public office.

If Gov. Chatto decides to hang up his political gloves – which is unlikely – or even if he does not, Mayor Veloso-Chatto certainly has a political career of her own to reckon with.

The spouse of first district Cong. Rene Relampagos may not possess a political position that Mayor Veloso-Chatto has in her resume but this does not mean she is a political tyro.

A former banker who married the congressman when he was governor, Imelda Adiong-Relampagos is a native of the town of Loay in Bohol’s third district.

Although not as prominent as the Velosos in Tagbilaran, the Adiongs in Loay are politically active where Imelda’s brother served as councilor.

Logically, she can run for representative in the first district or - in any unlikely event – even in the third district. 
Not much is known about Carol Gow-Yap, the wife of third district Rep. Arthur Yap. She has chosen to stay away from the limelight and left politics to her husband – for now.

A scion of a business clan from Loboc, she can be fielded to replace her husband in the third district if he decides to drop his gubernatorial aspirations.

The incumbents may or may not use their spouse card but the fact remains that it is there for them to draw out if something unforeseen shakes up Bohol’s political scenario in 2019.
