A generator set costing P1,624,000.00 which remained unused for more than two years from its acquisition for lack of a power house, may result to waste of government funds due to deterioration,” COA said in its audit report of the provincial government of Bohol.

It said that the generator set is one of the four sets procured by the provincial government totaling P5,373,000.00 for use of offices of the Governor’s mansion, Capitol annex, provincial motor pool and Camp Dagohoy.

The acquisition of the generator sets was due to the natural disasters including the earthquake on October 15, 2013 and typhoon Yolanda on November 8, 2013 that resulted to power blackout for months.

Of the four generator sets acquired, “the one assigned/delivered at Capitol annex were not put to use from the time of its delivery to present due to non-provision of a power house”, the COA report said.

“For two years, it remained idle and did not serve its purpose to the risk of deterioration and exposure to elements of nature thus waste of government funds tantamount to those enumerated under Annex “C” of COA circular 2012-003. Cases that are considered unnecessary expenditures of government funds and property,” COA stressed.

It also found after verification that the generator sets appeared to be a reconditioned unit; oil and oil filter are observed to have been in use, no keys for the door lock; no operation and maintenance manual submitted and worn out belts were observed.

But these defects in the said generator set have been fixed or replaced by the Capitol’s general servives office that the set is “running normal condition.”

In its reply to COA, Capitol said that the governor stressed the need of a powerhouse to be built, instructing the provincial administrator “to address the matter as soon as possible considering the wear and tear” of the set.

The governor also ordered its General Services Office (GSO) to check the functionality of said generator set while the provincial administrator “assured that the necessary structures will be constructed to make the generator set functional.”

COA recommended to the Capitol to make use of the generator set. (rvo)
