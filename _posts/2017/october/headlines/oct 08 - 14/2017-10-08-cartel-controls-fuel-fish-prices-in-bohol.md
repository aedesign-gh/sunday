A cartel is behind the high prices of petroleum products and fish being sold here according to reports reaching Bohol Sunday News last week.

BenjieOliva, a native of Catigbian town who is the incumbent administrator of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA), minced no words of alleging that prices of petroleum and fish sold in the province are manipulated by cartels.

Olivasaid that he believes that these commodities are controlled by only few families in Bohol.
But when pressed, he refused to name the cartel members and neither gave details how these cartel operatesby raking profits from petroleum and fish products they sell.

He added that the existence of cartel manipulating the prices of petroleum and fish or marine products should be investigated by the government.

He said in gist that what the provincial government and other agencies have done to help uplift the poor is insufficient apparently in resolving the perennial problem of the sky-rocketing prices of these products.
When prices of gasoline and other petroleum products go up, prices of fish also jack up, a middleman engaging in buy and sell fish said in interview.

Oliva was answering questions in ambush interview after the formal press conference of the CDA managing the holding of the 3rd Biennial Cooperative Congress of Central Visayas attended by cooperators from the province of Cebu, Negros Oriental, Siquijor and Bohol, the host.

Fishy fish prices: Why?

Why prices of fish sold in Bohol, particularly this capital city, are very different, in fact sky-rocketing, from other places?

For instance, “tulingan” is sold in this city at P140 to P180 per kilo. Reports said it depends on the weather, particularly when the moon is on the rise, which is always the easy excuse for the vendors.

In a check with other places like Cagayan de Oro City, capital of Misamis Oriental, the price of this species ranging from P100 to P140 per kilo sold at the same time. This situation is hounding, if not disturbing, Bohol for years now, the report added.

The paradox is that Bohol is abundant of fish and their catch, yet they are sold in neighboring places like Cebu City.

It was learned that there are factors affecting the fish prices. Of course, one is how market forces play that most of the times referred to law of supply and demand.

Other factors are blamed on “now-you-see-now-you-don’t” government action, like providing soft loan with low interest.

Likewise, loan sharks, some of those are engaged by “Indian-looking” lenders who collect payments daily, according a middleman.

What is perceived to be “cartel” is another though some government officials are not convinced on this.
The SangguniangPanlalawigan is trying again to look into the high prices of fish in the province.

This came following Board Member Tomas Abapo Jr. delivering a privilege speech where he moved for another investigation to look into aspectd surrounding the issue on high fish prices in the province.

Abapo’s manifestation was referred to the agriculture committee chaired by Board Member AbeleonDamalerio.
Abapo, earlier, raised the grave concern of high prices of petroleum products here and even proposed for the provincial government to put up its own gasoline stations which is now under study. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
