Bohol incumbents: To jump ship or not (3rdof a series)

BY CHITO A. FUENTES

TAGBILARAN CITY – The biggest dilemma facing Bohol incumbents going into the 2019 mid-term elections is the question on whether to jump ship to the administration or not.

Gov. Edgardo M. Chatto, Rep. Rene L.Relampagos and Rep. Arthur C.  Yap were the three main pillars of the administration during the heydays of the Liberal Party (LP).

Chatto led the Lakas administration bets in 2010 that defeated the LP slate of actor Cesar Montano and now third district Board Member ElpidioM. Jala and the Nacionalista tandem of former Vice Gov. Julius Caesar F. Herrera and incumbent second district Board Member Tomas D. Abapo Jr.

Relampagos, who defeated LP bet Edgar Kapirig, was the first to jump ship to the LP after ex-Pres.Benigno Aquino III won the 2010 presidential polls. Chatto followed soon after.

Yap never took his oath as LP but it is open knowledge that he was a part of the LP juggernaut in Bohol during the Aquino administration.

In 2013, the LP candidate, former Loboc Mayor Leon Calipusan, withdrew his candidacy after the deadline for substitution had lapsed.

An LP congressional bet withdrawing under an LP administration was illogical but it happened in Bohol after Calipusan conceded he was not welcomed into the virtual administration fraternity by Chatto and the Bohol LP.
In 2016, the LP again did not field a candidate against Yap that can only lead to one conclusion: except for the party nomination, Yap was the administration bet in the third district.

Fast forward to 2017.

More than a year into the Duterte administration, the exodus into PDP-Laban - the new administration party – by the big 3 has not happened.

There are speculations on why this is but everything is fluid at this time so it is pointless to engage in them.

The fact remains, however, is that if the big 3, should they decide to stick together no matter what, will find themselves in an unfamiliar situation – which is running under the opposition LP banner.

Yap has made no bones about his intention to run for governor, and he might do it under the Nationalist People’s Coalition, which appointed him provincial chairman in 2013 or a local party that would align with the administration.

But like Chatto and Relampagos, he has to contend with that part of history where Boholanos normally vote for the administration bet.

Considering that President Rodrigo Duterte overwhelmingly won despite the spirited LP campaign for Mar Roxas in 2016 bannered by Chatto, Relampagos and Yap, it is one possibility that they and the rest of the LP political lieutenants dread.

To jump ship to the administration or not? 

They will have to decide on that soon while there is still time otherwise it will be taken to mean as an open challenge to the administration PDP-Laban.
