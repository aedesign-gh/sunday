Well, it depends upon which side of the bread is being buttered if one reports on the latest political situation in the province last week.

This after the Liberal Party (LP) in Bohol led by Gov. Edgar M. Chatto and the two congressmen, Rene L. Relampagos and Art C. Yap of the first and third district respectively, made a loyalty check early last week on the town mayors aligned with them through a clandestine gathering held in the town of Baclayon.
Apparently, the political gathering took the bait of the ruling PartidoDemokratiko Pilipino-Lakasng Bayan (PDP-Laban) who earlier set an oath-taking of town mayors joining the party of Pres. Duterte.
Senate Pres. Koko Pimentel and House Speaker Bebot Alvarez were reported to be coming over for the oath-taking set last Friday.

The LP leadership immediately draw the gun and immediately called a meeting of the town mayors identified with Chatto, Relampagos and Yap. 

Under the present set-up, Chatto is the LP provincial chairman while Relampagos is the first district coordinator.

Yap, who is card-bearing member of the Nationalist Peoples Coalition (NPC) has been politically aligned with Chatto and Relampagos.

As of the latest count, only 24 municipal mayors attended the meeting in Baclayon last Tuesday.

A party insider told the Bohol Sunday News that town mayors were told that if they decide to jump ship to the PDP-Laban, LP will put up a candidate against them.

As usual, money changed hands after the meeting.

In the same development, reports said that the LP leadership told Rep. ArisAumentado of the second district that if he continues leading the opposition, the LP leadership will put up a congressional bet against him in 2019.

However, the second district solon is no longer annoyed by the threat as the group always came up with a candidate in the second district.

After the LP gathering in Baclayon, the purported PDP-Laban oath-taking was eventually cancelled. 

Meanwhile, the name of Yap and Relampagos were floated as the possible gubernatorial tandem in 2019.

The report also said that the third district solon may as well jump ship to the Lakas-Kampi party of former Pres. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who is a known ally of Pres. Duterte.

Yap has also made public his closeness to Pres. Duterte as he was always tagged by the latter in his recent foreign trips.

In the meantime, Yap is also facing criminal raps with the Sandiganbayan in relation to the PDAF scam while he was still agriculture secretary. He is presently out of jail on two bail bonds.
