What started to be a mere low pressure area last week turned out to become a severe typhoon and battered the seawaters around this island province bringing heavy rains, rough seas and strong winds.

This surfaced as Typhoon Paolo, with same name of the Davao City vice-mayor and one of the President’s son, showed the nature’s anger by threatening the lives of boat passengers, causing unscheduled power interruptions and even landslides in the province for almost a week.

Hundreds of stranded boat passengers, mostly Boholanos, were reported in Cebu as trips of fast crafts were cancelled since Thursday until yesterday.

As this developed, Paolo is expected to leave the Philippine Area of Responsibility(PAR) today. Sunday.
Metro Manila, the rest of Mindanao, Central Luzon and Calabarzon will also experience cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms. Coastal waters will be moderate to rough.

Residents of the said areas are alerted against possible flashfloods/landslides due to moderate to occasionally heavy rains that soften the ground.

Sea travel is risky over the northwestern Luzon, the eastern seaboard of Central and Southern Luzon, the seaboard of Palawan, western and eastern seaboards of Visayas and the northern and eastern seaboards of Mindanao.

“Paolo” has slightly changed its course by moving towards northeast direction, state weather agency Philippine Atmospheric, Geographical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said Friday.

In its weather advisory, Paolo was last observed at 850 kilometers east of Basco, Batanes as of noon Friday. It has maximum sustained winds of up to 130 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 160 kph.

Boholanos felt the gruelling experience of Paolo when at least 15 passengers aboard Lite Ferry 26, a roll on-roll off vessel of Lite Shipping Corporation, were rescued on Friday afternoon after seawater entered the vessel while on its way to Tubigon from Cebu.

Lite Ferry 26 departed Ouano Wharf in Mandaue City at 12 noon and was expected to arrive Tubigon at 4:30 in the afternoon of the same day.

However, the Cebu Station of the Philippine Coast Guard received a call from Lite Ferry 26, reporting that waters have entered the vessel.

According to the crew of Lite Ferry 26, huge waves kept on slamming against the vessel while traversing the seas between Bohol and Cebu.

The ramp then opened “after being repeatedly slammed by huge waves and strong wind”.

In Garcia-Hernandez town, a landslide occurred at coastal barangay Cayamlast Wednesday believed to be result of the continuous downpour due to Typhoon Paolo.

But nobody was hurt and barangay officials with the help of limestone company’s heavy equipment immediately cleared the debris.

Meanwhile, unscheduled power service interruptions were experienced in several parts of the province last week. 

Betty Martinez, corporate spokesperson of the National Grip Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) confirmed that brownouts occurred in parts of Bohol last Friday noon time served the Bohol Electric Cooperative (BOHECO) I and II and the Bohol Light Company (BLCI).

The reason for the brief brownout was the tripping of 69kV Tagbilaran-Garcia line.

Another unscheduled power interruption in parts of Bohol at 5:47pm last Friday affecting parts of BOHECO II again due to the tripping of the 69kV Ubay-Alicia-Garcia line.

Initial report is a bamboo pole fell on the line due to strong winds from Typhoon Paulo. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
