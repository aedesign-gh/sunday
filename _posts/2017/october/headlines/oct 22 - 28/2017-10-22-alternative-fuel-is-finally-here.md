The weird weather here this week lays the seemingly fitting premise for a real and drastic measure towards mitigating effects of climate change, one which would be the main topic in the government's promotion for innovations in alternative fuels and energy efficient technologies this week.

The Department of Energy (DOE) in cooperation with the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) conducts this week a Seminar on the “Promotion of Energy Sector Innovation through the Use of Alternative Fuels and Energy Technologies” on Oct. 24 at the KEW Hotel this city.

The whole-day advocacy intends to create greater awareness and appreciation of the importance of cleaner alternative energy fuels and energy technologies and efficient utilization of energy, sums up PIA Central Visayas Assistant Regional Director Fayette Riñen.

This too as a global movement towards the reduction of the use of fossil fuels that are heavily building up the global carbon emissions index snowballs here and elsewhere in the globe.

It should have good and relevant inputs to transport groups who are now wrestling with their cumbersome vehicles that are by all means needing phasing out having seen better days, while taking a peek at the more eco-friendly solutions the government intends to support, a DOE offical said.

Among the projects that the DOE would be presenting on Tuesday would be a known alternative fuel source such as the liquefied petroleum gas for automobiles (Auto-LPG) Program aiming to arrest air pollution by vehicular emission.

Invited during the seminar are drivers, auto mechanics, engineers and industry workers, academe, government information officers, student group representatives and commuters who may have to ask nagging issues about LPG leaks in taxis and their effects when improperly installed.

Also up in line are the Natural Gas for Vehicles Program for Public Transport.

The Philippines is now using compressed natural gas from its Malampaya natural gas fields and is now set up in a CNG plant in southern Luzon.

CNG, being a natural gas which is methane at high pressure is a fuel alternative for gasoline, Diesel fuel and propane or LPG, but when it is in its CNG for, it produces fewer undesirable gases than fossil fuels, according to automotive experts.

Moreover, the DOE also brings to Bohol discussions on the use of e-jeepneys and e trikes which uses powered by lithium-ion batteries and their issues if only to clarify things.

Pres.Duterte has been intending to make a transport system revamp by phasing out the older jeepneys for the more environment friendly electric vehicles and the electric tram system.

For the Bohol seminar, top DOE officials would be resource speakers as the information campaign hopes to tap partnerships with the different sectors in Bohol to spread the initiatives of government to pursue clean energy, Rinen added.

Those interested to attend the seminar can contact 501 8554 on Monday from 9:00 to 3:00, to get into the limited slots left, according to seminar co-organizers PIA Bohol. (rahc/PIA-7/Bohol)
