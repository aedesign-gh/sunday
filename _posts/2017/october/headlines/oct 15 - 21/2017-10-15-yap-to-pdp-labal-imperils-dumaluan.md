The formal entry of Rep. Arthur C. Yap (3rd District, Bohol) to the ruling PartidoDemokratiko Pilipino-Lakasng Bayan (PDP-Laban) last Wednesday practically imperils the leadership of Dr.DoloreichDumaluan as the partyâ€™s chairman in the province.

Under the doctrine of the equity of the incumbent, Yap will become the highest PDP-Laban member in Bohol. Thus, Dumaluan, based in Panglao town, will have to give way to the third district solon.

Yap joined the oath-taking of former Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, now congressman of Pampanga, last Wednesday before House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez in the House of Representatives in Quezon City.

Joining the oath-taking was the Nasser Pangandaman, former secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) during the Arroyo administration.

Yap also served as agriculture secretary.

In an interview with Station DYTR last week. Dumaluan expressed his surprise over the move of Cong. Yap to join the ruling party.

The former Panglao mayor still holds the chairmanship of the ruling party here despite the victory of Vice Gov. Dionisio D. Balite who is currently on a nine-month suspension.

But with the entry of Yap in the PDP-Laban, he can easily secure an appointment either from Speaker Alvarez or from Senate Pres. Koko Pimentel to lead the party in the province.

During the recent meeting of the Liberal Party (LP) in Baclayon town last week, the name of Yap and Rep. Rene L. Relampagos was floated as the possible gubernatorial tandem in 2019.

Neither of the two congressmen confirmed the report.

Earlier, it was earlier reported that Yap will jump ship from the Nationalist Peoples Coalition (NPC) to the Lakas-Kampi lead by Arroyo, but apparently there was a deviation of the plan as both Arroyo and Yap joined the ruling party instead.

Arroyo and Yap were among the political allies of Pres. Duterte. 

In fact, Yap joined the President in several of his foreign trips.

Meanwhile, key officials of the KilusangPagbabago (KP) in Bohol and the Bohol Alliance for Change (BAC) are reportedly consolidating their forces preparing for a possible confrontation with the Yap-Relampagos tandem in the 2019 gubernatorial elections.

Highly placed sources told the Bohol Sunday News that the group is now considering all possible political moves in the event that Cabinet Sec. LeoncioEvasco will decide to throw his hat in the gubernatorial race in the next local polls or may endorse Rep. Aris C. Aumentado as its bet.
