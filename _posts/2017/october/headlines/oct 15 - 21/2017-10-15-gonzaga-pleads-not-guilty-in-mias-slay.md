The principal suspect in the killing of Atty Mia Manuelita C. Mascariňas-Green pleaded not guilty during his arraignment at the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bohol Branch 1 last Friday morning.

Llyod S. Gonzaga, presently detained at the Tagbilaran City Jail, pleaded not guilty in Criminal Case No. 20136 for murder and in Criminal Case No. 20137 for attempted murder.

Gonzaga was also arraigned in Criminal Case No. 20420 for illegal possession of illegal drugs penalized under Republic Act No. 9165.

He was represented by Atty. Philipp S. Pantojan.

The prosecution panel for murder and attempted murder cases was composed of City Prosecutor Bebiana Bautista and private counsels, Atty. Jun Amora, Atty. Em-emBernido and Atty. Ted Lagang.

Pantojan argued that the private prosecutors did not have the conformity of the bereaved family of the late environmental lawyer.

However, this was overruled by the court who claimedthat the presence of private prosecutors in a criminal case has the implied authority from the victim or the family.

RomaricoBenegian, the other accused in the murder and frustrated murder cases remains at large.

The Hall of Justice became a beehive of activities last Friday morning as another high-profile case was also set for arraignment with RTC Branch 48. 

This time, involving the Col. Christina Nobleza and his alleged lover, RenierDongon involving the case of the intrusion of the bandit Abu Sayyaf Group.

A portion of B. Inting St. this city was declared one-way during the entire duration of the hearing as patrol cards and other security vehicles parked in the middle of the street to provide security. The arraignment was also reset.
