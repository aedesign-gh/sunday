Four years after magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck the province, several questions remained unanswered until today.

Years back, the provincial government always took the lead in marking the so-called great quake which destroyed hundreds of houses, churches and other major infrastructures like bridges and roads.

But there were a lot of mixed reactions in marking the catastrophe as to whether it will be commemorated or not.

On the fourth anniversary of the earthquake hitting Bohol on Oct. 15, 2013, there is no more highlights except for the so called “Pasalamat 2017” held yesterday at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary (IHMS) in Taloto District this city.

The Bohol Rehabilitation and Rebuilding Program (BRRP) was hosted by the Diocese of Tagbilaran.
Of course, Gov. Edgar M. Chatto and City Mayor Baba Yap were present. 

It thus reminded us of the some several questions like the highly politicized P2.3 billion Bohol Earthquake Assistance (BEA) funds coming from the Department of Interior and Local Governments (DILG) then headed by Sec. Mar Roxas.

Is it already exhausted? What towns became the recipient of the funds? Are they truly hit by the earthquake?
Apparently, there was no official disclosure on how the funds were allocated and what towns were the recipients.

Until today, there is also no official inventory on how much did the province received from international countries, non-governmental organizations and from other local government units in the country.

Reports on earthquake affected residents being relocated in tents along the highways are still there like in the town of Loon.

The answer to these questions are still unavailable as everybody wanted to forget the ill-effects of the great Bohol quake.
