What to do with Evasco?

Teaser for incumbents 
(Fourth of a series)

By CHITO A. FUENTES

TAGBILARAN CITY – No thanks to a tactical blunder by the incumbents and their friends in the media, the incumbents have succeeded in forcing a question that they themselves have to answer: what to do with Cabinet Sec. LeoncioEvasco?

In recent weeks - as if on cue - media reports began putting political color on the series of speaking engagements Evasco gave in different parts of Bohol.

Instead of recognizing the fact that Evasco merely honored the invitations he received, the reports made it appear that the opposite was true: the initiative came from him. 
This is, of course, farthest from the truth.

Those who know Evasco know enough than to even imagine him orchestrating his presence in speaking events like some politicians we know.

The game plan was obvious – to force Evasco to either admit or deny that he has gubernatorial plans. While the Cabinet Secretary may not have the political savvy of the politicians who is forcing him into the wall, Evasco is not exactly a political tyro either.

Interestingly though, it is the incumbents who find themselves teased to make a choice whether to make friends with Evasco, or declaring war against him.

A few things are worth considering before anything.

First, Evasco may or may not run. Let us consider the second one first.

If he decides to play safe and stay in the Cabinet instead of taking a gamble for a Capitol seat, it would be better for any gubernatorial wannabe to have Evasco on his or her side.

Evasco’s endorsement would be a virtual support from the administration, what with all the government agencies at his disposal. This, of course, aside from many intangibles the position carries with it.

Conventional wisdom dictates that it would be better for the incumbents – regardless of their political plans - to have Evasco on their side.

Now, here comes the most interesting part.

Should Evasco decide to run, the incumbents will have to choose whether to support him or his opponent – most likely Rep. Arthur Yap.

Yap, for those who missed the news, incidentally just jumped ship to the administration PDP-Laban along with his erstwhile political patron, Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

In last week’s instalment of this series, the question was asked on whether the incumbents would join the opposition or not. Yap, whether he read that instalment or not, swiftly answered the question in the affirmative.

Whether the other incumbents, notably Gov. Edgardo M. Chatto and Rep. Rene L. Relampagos, follow Yap’s leading in the coming days or not is anybody’s guess.

Just one little secret needs to be revealed for anyone who is interested.

Prior to the 2016 elections, then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte asked his loyal political lieutenant how much it would take for the latter to run for governor of Bohol.

Evasco swiftly brushed aside the question because he was fixated on the gargantuan challenge of making his principal win.

Would it be far-fetch to expect the same question to be asked of him, again, no longer by a city mayor but the President of the Republic himself?

Without a doubt, Evasco would have to think hard before answering in the event that Duterte asks him a second time.

He won’t be alone though. Contrary to what the incumbents and their subalterns thought, they are not exactly the ones asking questions. 

In fact, the more difficult questions are reserved for them.
