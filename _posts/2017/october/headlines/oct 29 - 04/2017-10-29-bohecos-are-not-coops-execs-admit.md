TUBIGON. – Officials of the electric cooperative here admitted last week that Bohol Electric Cooperatives (BOHECO) are not cooperatives.

 But BOHECO I general manager Dino Roxas and president MarcialDegamo countered that they operate thru a special law that makes it “unique,”.
 
They said BOHECO operate under Presidential Decree No. 269 and umbrella of the National Electrification Administration (NEA) which Usec. Orlando Ravanerawho chairs the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) hinted of abolishing the agency.

The officials said they have options whether to put the electric coop under the CDA or NEA but majority of the members choose the latter.

The BOHECOs reaction came following the statements of Ravanera and CDA Administrator BenjieOlivathat electric cooperatives are not cooperatives.

This he told press conference held at Bohol Tropics Resort here for launching the 3rd Biennial Cooperative Congress in Central Visayas hosted by the provincial government of Bohol.

This surfaced even as reports said that most electric cooperative members are perennially clamoring for benefits from the BOHECOs established here.

A member said that he has been affiliated with electric coop as member-consumer here but he never heard nor received benefits, like dividends or patronage refund and others.

Every coop member must be recognized as member-consumer-owner to give social justice to everyone, Ravanera said.

The prevailing situation that electric coop members are not benefited is a form of “social wrong” that must be rectified, he said.

But for Cabinet Sec. LeoncioEvasco Jr., in separate interview, the law governing the National Electrification Administration (NEA) by which all the electric coops are under should be amended.

With this scenario, CDA said that not all electric coops are registered as mandated by cooperative law.
Ravanera said that of the 113 electric coops in the country only 13 are registered with CDA.

There are 26,000 coops in the country and 1,770 in Bohol. These employ 2 million indirect and 500,000 direct jobs, the CDA said. But only 82% of the 26,000 are considered compliant cooperatives, he added.

Both Ravanera and Evasco expressed that they are in favor of amending the said law governing the NEA and electric cooperatives apparently to make it mandatory for electric coops to register with CDA.

Ravanera, a native of Cagayan de Oro City, capital of Misamis Oriental, recalled that then Vice-President Emmanuel Pelaez, also a native of said province wanted to energize the rural areas in the entire country.
But as to how to do it, Pelaez and other officials at that time did not have any idea, or whether to imitate what the Aboitiz or the Meralco have done in Davao and Manila, respectively.

Pelaez and his group then arrived at a concept turning electric consumers into cooperatives.

Millions of funds in the form of grants from the World Bank were poured to bankroll electric cooperatives especially during Martial law when NEA already managing them. But NEA then was controlled by military generals, Ravanera said.

Until after EDSA when the CDA was crafted but still electric cooperatives appeared to be reluctant to be under the CDA because of the law governing the NEA. (rvo)
