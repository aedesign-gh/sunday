The Commission on Audit has directed Bohol Gov. Edgar M. Chatto, former Vice Gov. Concepcion O, Lim, suspended Provincial Administrator AeDamalerio and twoother provincial officials to return the P2.437-million provincial fund spent on “personalized” calendars in 2011, reports gathered by the Bohol Sunday News last week said.
In a three-page decision dated Sept. 27, the COA Commission Proper has affirmed with finality the Notice of Disallowance issued by its Regional Office VII in May 2013 in connection with the purchase of the personalized calendars.

The report was also published by the Philippine Star last week, 

The COA said Chatto and the four other provincial officials filed their joint appeal before Commission Proper nine days beyond the 180-day period provided under the COA rules of procedure, thus the decision of its regional office “shall become final and executory.”

While the COA decision did not explicitly identify whose image appears in the calendars, the commission said the purchase was “contrary” to the Department of the Interior and Local Government Memorandum Circular No. 308-97 which urges all local officials “to reflect on their personalized calendars the pictures of their completed projects where human resource development is a major component instead of their pictures.”

The COA also cited Administrative Order No. 103 Series of 2004 which suspends the spending on paid media advertisements except for those related to announcement of agency guidelines, rules and regulations, conduct of public bidding or dissemination of important public advisories.

The audit body said Bohol government's purchase of the personalized calendars also violated COA Circular No. 85-055-A which prohibits “unnecessary” expenditures or uses of funds and property, including those for “advertisements of anniversaries, etc. in newspapers, TV, or radio merely for publicity or propaganda purposes.”

The decision was signed by COA Chairman Michael Aguinaldo and Comm. Jose Fabia and Isabel Agito.

Aside from Chatto, also directed to jointly return the P2.437-million provincial fund were former Vice Gov. Concepcion O. Lim, suspended Provincial Administrator Alfonso R. Damalerio II, Provincial Treasurer EustaquioSocorin, Provincial Accountant JosethCelocia and requisitioning office head Engr. GabinoRedulla.
