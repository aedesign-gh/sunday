A bill seeking to declare Dec. 5 every year as Datu Sikatuna Day in Sikatuna town has been approved by the House committee on revision of laws, the office of Cong. Rene L. Relampagos said yesterday.

Sikatuna attained its stature as an independent municipality on December 5, 1917 by virtue of Executive Order No. 88, issued by then Governor General Francis Burton Harisson. 

Sikatuna is a political entity rich with historic events. Named after the ancient chieftain of Bohol, Datu Sikatuna, the municipality according to historical records, served as a haven for evacuees from the neighboring towns and provinces during the World War II. 

Sikatuna is a 5th income class municipality in Bohol with a total land area of 2,675 hectares composed of 10 barangays and is about 17 kilometers from Tagbilaran. It is richly endowed with natural resources, scenery and historical significance.

Earlier in this Congress, Rep. Relampagos filed a bill seeking to declare July 4 of every year as “Francisco Dagohoy Day” to be commemorated in the whole province.

Under the said bill, all local leaders of Bohol as well as the Department of Education – Regional Office are encouraged to plan and implement activities for the “Francisco Dagohoy Day,” and ensure that Dagohoy’s legacy of courage and heroism is given emphasis to encourage the youth to continue the good values and patriotism he demonstrated. 

“Why do we need these laws?” Relampagos queried. “These are not meant only to have an additional one day off every year from school and work. More than that, we need to look at our roots, respect the heroes who made Bohol what it is today and inculcate in the youths the values they have shared. Bohol is humbled to have homed and nurtured great Filipino heroes such as Datu Sikatuna and Francisco Dagohoy. This is our simplest gesture to ensure that their legacies live on. Declarations of special days such as these, hopefully, will compel discussions and open venues for Boholanos to reflect on the contributions of our respected heroes”.

“The bill proposing the Datu Sikatuna Day has already been approved in the Committee on Revision of Laws, subject to some documentary requirements.  While the bill proposing to declare the Dagohoy Day has already been approved by the Committee early this year,” the lawmaker reported.
