True to the analysis published here last Sunday, the camp of Cabinet Sec. Leoncio B. Evasco Jr. decried last Friday an organized attack from a gubernatorial wannabe.

In the analysis penned by veteran journalist Chito A. Fuentes entitled “What to do with Evasco, fight or compromise”, incumbents identified and aligned with the Liberal Party (LP) in Bohol has chosen the first option: fight Evasco instead of entering into a compromise.

Political observers said it could also be both, attack first before entering into a compromise.
An insider in Evasco’s camp posted in his Facebook account a series of attacks naming the culprit as a mere “insik”.

But a verification made by this paper revealed that the accusation pointed to Cong. Arthur C. Yap of the third district. Yap was earlier reported to be eyeing the gubernatorial post after meeting LP members in Baclayon town,

Yap jump ship from the National Peoples Coalition (NPC) to the ruling Laban ngDemokratikong Pilipino-Lakasng Bayan (PDP-Laban) together with ex-Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who is now a congressman representing Pampanga.

Yap used to be the agriculture secretary during the term of Arroyo as president.

In that recent LP gathering in Baclayon, the possible gubernatorial tandem of Yap and Rep. Rene L. Relampagos was also floated.

Winston A. Rabi, a supporter of Evasco revealed through his Facebook account that a reporter complete with an identification card tried to interview Evasco who was at his house in Maribojoc recently.

Rabi noted that the reporter was very aggressive and wanted to ask Evasco about his gubernatorial plans.
Detecting that the reporter is planted, Evasco answered point blank the questions saying that it was not his job to answer gubernatorial plans.

When double-checked by Rabi, a program aired over Station DYTR which conducted a survey on the prospective bets for governor, a caller hit Evasco for allegedly throwing his temperament to a media reporter.

Secondly, Rabi noted how Yap allegedly manipulated the clash between Presidential Assistant Bong Go and Evasco.

Adding insult to injury, Rabi claimed that reports said some unidentified persons were collecting money from municipal mayors using the name of Evasco.

Rabi said Yap is now resorting to dirty tactics just to pursue his plans to run for governor in 2019.
This despite the non-interest of Evasco to run for the top post at the Capitol, Rabi added.
Efforts to contact Yap and his office also proved futile until press time.
