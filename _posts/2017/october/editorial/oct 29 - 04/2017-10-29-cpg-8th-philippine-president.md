We have to set aside our piece this week and give way to the 121st natal day of the late Pres. Carlos P. Garcia, Boholâ€™s most illustrious son this coming Saturday.

Garcia, the 8th President of the Republic of the Philippines, has a highway in Manila and a main street in Tagbilaran City.

There is a proposal that the circumferential road will also be named after him but that is a different story and must be set aside because there is something political behind the proposal which is a counter-proposal in naming the circumferential road after the former governor and former congressman in the second district, Erico B. Aumentado.

Well, speaking of the late governor and congressman, there were stories in the past that Aumentado could be a son of the late Carlos P. Garcia though we do not buy that story.

Probably due to the similarity of their hair loss and the way they speak, the allegation cannot take a first base.

At any rate, the present millennial generation among Boholanos could hardly trace the history and the biography of the late Boholano president. 

This even if we cannot foresee in our lifetime if ever we can produce another Presidentiable in our midst and take Malacanang for the second time after Garcia.

In the first place, no Boholano politician nowadays is free from any charges of corruption and noted for being honest and truthful while being in public service.

Almost all Bohol leaders now have cases on corruption or being linked to graft and corruption. They may have posted bail bonds for their temporary liberty and maneuvered to have their cases in a very low profile and let their constituents be ignorant of their cases.

This did not happen during the lifetime of Pres. Garcia since he started his political career in 1925.
That is why we foresee no current Bohol leader could enter into the national political limelight and be considered as a presidentiable.

In the meantime, let us just be contented in having the 8th President of the Republic as a Boholano born on November 4, 1896 in Talibon, Bohol and died on June 14, 1971 widely recognized for his Filipino First Policy. (DAB)
