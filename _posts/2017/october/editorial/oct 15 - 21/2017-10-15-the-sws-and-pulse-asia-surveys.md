The SWS and Pulse Asia Surveys

This weekend, we were confronted with two contradictory results of the Social Weather Station (SWS) and Pulse Asia surveys, which was done practically at the same time last month, and both claiming scientifically warranted procedures, have raised eyebrows and doubts. 

Firstly, in the SWS survey, Pres. Duterte’s net satisfaction and trust ratings have drastically dropped, with the steepest in income classes D and E. 

On the other hand, the Pulse Asia survey claims that while there is a slight drop in the President’s approval and trust ratings, they are practically at the same level compared to the second quarter numbers, with the highest rating in income class E.

It was as if the two survey companies talked about two entirely different countries.

Supporters of Pres. Duterte have been quick to dismiss the SWS survey as probably rigged.

Indeed, there are enough reasons to doubt the SWS survey. The sharp decline in the D and E crowd, even as the numbers for the ABC income classes remained relatively unchanged, tells you of the existence of a class-specific issue. 

What is offered as an explanation is that the decline was due to the perception by the poor that they are being targeted by the drug war. It was around the time of the survey that Kian de los Santos died at the hands of the Caloocan police.

The context for this steep decline in the trust and satisfaction ratings of the President was laid down when SWS earlier released the results of their survey on alleged extra-judicial killings. 

The results showed that majority of the people allegedly believe that those who died in the hands of the police are probably not guilty, and would probably not have resisted arrest. Many also believed that many victims were wrongfully included in the police list.

However, in another SWS survey, majority of the people were satisfied with the war on drugs, and even lauded the President for his anti-crime and anti-drug efforts.

Something just doesn’t add up. Unless there is another plausible explanation, such as the fact that the poor are not satisfied with the President’s economic policies, for which no data exists to back it up, then the SWS survey not only on the war on drugs and EJK, but also on the President’s satisfaction and trust ratings will always be in doubt.

This is why Duterte supporters welcomed the Pulse Asia survey as the one that is more believable. It strengthens the view that the people still trust and still approve of the President’s performance, despite the political opposition’s concerted efforts to demonize him.

Thus, it is easy to interpret the Pulse Asia survey results as a failure of the political opposition.
