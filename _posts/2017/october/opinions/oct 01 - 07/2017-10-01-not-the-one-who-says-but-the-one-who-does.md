26th Sunday of the Year(cycle A)
Readings:	Ezek18:25-28; Phil2:1-11; Mt21:28-32

Some years ago I was invited to spend the Holy Week with the Filipino community in Athens, Greece.  One time, I made a tour at the city by myself and by only reading map, road signs, and by asking the locals for direction.  I wanted to go to the famous Acropolis and since I am not so familiar with the modern Greek language, I only asked to locals by speaking English.  “Is this the right way to the Acropolis?” I asked.  The person only answered me with a nod which I understood as affirmative.  But I realized that I was moving farther away from the Acropolis.  I told some Filipinos about the incident and they said that it is different there because for some locals to nod the head means “no”.  This gesture is also the same in Bulgaria, the head nod up and down means “no”, and the head shake means “yes”.

I can very much relate my experience with our Gospel this Sunday.  We heard of the parable of a man who has two sons.  The father asked them that they should go to the vineyard to work.  One son said “yes” but he did not go, the other son said “no” but he went.

Now let us understand the context of the Gospel.  The meaning of this parable is crystal clear. The Jewish leaders are the people who said they would obey God and then did not. The tax-gatherers and the harlots are those who said that they would go their own way and then took God's way.

The key to the correct understanding of this parable is that it is not really praising anyone. It is setting before us a picture of two very imperfect sets of people, of whom one set were none the less better than the other. Neither son in the story was the kind of son to bring full joy to his father. Both were unsatisfactory; but the one who in the end obeyed was incalculably better than the other. The ideal son would be the son who accepted the father's orders with obedience and with respect and who unquestioningly and fully carried them out. But there are truths in this parable which go far beyond the situation in which it was first spoken.

It tells us that there are two very common classes of people in this world. First, there are the people whose profession is much better than their practice. They will promise anything; they make great protestations of piety and fidelity; but their practice lags far behind. Second, there are those whose practice is far better than their profession. They claim to be tough, hardheaded materialists, but somehow they are found out doing kindly and generous things, almost in secret, as if they were ashamed of it. They profess to have no interest in the Church and in religion, and yet, when it comes to the bit, they live more Christian lives than many professing Christians.

We have all of us met these people, those whose practice is far away from the almost sanctimonious piety of their profession, and those whose practice is far ahead of the sometimes cynical, and sometimes almost irreligious, profession which they make. The real point of the parable is that, while the second class are infinitely to be preferred to the first, neither is anything like perfect. The really good man is the man in whom profession and practice meet and match.

Further, this parable teaches us that promises can never take the place of performance, and fine words are never a substitute for fine deeds. The son who said he would go, and did not, had all the outward marks of courtesy. In his answer he called his father "Sir" with all respect. But a courtesy which never gets beyond words is a totally illusory thing. True courtesy is obedience, willingly and graciously given. On the other hand the parable teaches us that a man can easily spoil a good thing by the way he does it. He can do a fine thing with a lack of graciousness and a lack of winsomeness which spoil the whole deed. Here we learn that the Christian way is in performance and not promise, and that the mark of a Christian is obedience graciously and courteously given.
