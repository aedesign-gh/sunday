Almost every day, we passed by the site where the late Atty. Mia Manuelita C. Mascarinas-Green was ambushed in broad daylight at the corner of Zamora St. and Tagbilaran-Corella road last Feb. 15.

The tarpaulins keep us reminded over the gruesome killing of a lady lawyer who was unarmed and helpless at the hands of the perpetrators and in the very presence of her young children.
We wanted to join the movement advocating for justice for Mia but we were discouraged upon sensing that some political colours were tried to inject it. So we distanced from joining the activities.

Considering that yellow-tendency of the Justice for Mia has died down, we joined the time table to count down the solution to the killing of a paniera and a close friend since college.

Using our medium for our advocacy for Mia, we always give prominence to any development in the manhunt for her killers.

The arrest of the alleged mastermind of the killing in Davao City brought headline to this paper although the other suspect is still at large. Well, we know that the arrest of the other suspect is already forthcoming.

However, we were surprised for the arrest of one of the alleged gunmen in the killing of Mia in Dauis town yesterday. The arrest of one Vladimir AhmedsonCagata, a resident of Barangay Tinago, Dauis.

Apparently, the justice for Mia has levelled up although the trial of the case has yet to begin.

One by one, the people behind the killing of Mia will finally be brought to justice, sooner or later.

However, we were just reminded of the bounty being offered by the bereaved family and those from abroad. Were the money already accounted for with the arrest of two of the suspects?
Just like any other movement, Justice for Mia was massive when it was launched with various activity. But it just died down or was it just part of the come-ons for the movement. The activity must be continued especially now that the trial of the case has been delayed due to the dilly-dallying tactic of the alleged perpetrators.

Unfortunately, no one stood up to fight for the cause. At the very start, the social media was beehive of posts and comments. Now, they all died down despite the fact that the criminal case has still not gone into trial.

Where are you people especially at this time that Justice for Mia is already coming. As the oft-repeated answer would say, your answer is as good as mine.
