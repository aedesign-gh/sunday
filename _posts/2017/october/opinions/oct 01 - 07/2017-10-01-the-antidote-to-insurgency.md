In one of the issues of  The Agora, I discussed about reports of armed men being sighted in different barangays of towns in Bohol that used to be considered havens of the insurgent CPP-NPA-NDF before they decided it was time to leave Bohol in 2010. While the military could not conclude that they are back, the circumstances point to them trying to come back.

These sightings are indicators that the CPP-NPA-NDF have plans of returning or regaining their old turfs either because they consider the present environment favourable to come back or because it is the tail end of the present local administration and the leadership being politicians would lower or relax their guards against issues that could reduce their chances of getting new or renewed mandates from the voting populace.Anyway, for whatever reason or reasons, they are showing their intention of coming back.

Bohol, however, has shown that it could continue to be insurgent-free.  Gov. Constancio ‘Nonoy’ Torralba had only one term as Governor of Bohol but he started the program that became the seed of an LGU-led counter-insurgency program through poverty reduction. Gov. Nonoy had his Forward Base Barangay Team of volunteer community organizers-community development officers (CO-CD) established first in Brgys.Dagohoy and Bonifacio in Bilar, the known hotbed then of the growing CPP-NPA movement in the mid and late 80s.  It was a composite team of provincial and national government employees who were not afraid to serve the people by living in the very community where the CPP-NPAs have established their lair. Their only objective then was to secure the presence and services of government in their barangays of assignment.

When Gov. Rene L. Relampagos succeeded Gov. David B. Tirol at the helm of the provincial government of Bohol, he renamed the program into People’s Enhancement Program (PEP) and expanded it to the municipalities of Balilihan, Danao, and Catigbian.  The concept did not change but this time it was enhanced with the assistance of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Peace Process (OPPAP).  He only had two terms as Governor but he was already able to secure the surrender of a few CPP cadres.

Gov. Erico B. Aumentado would have rejected the program had he been a full time politician because Gov. Rene was the incumbent that he defeated in the elections of 2001.  But Gov. Erico was development oriented and was only a politician during election period.  His principle was to build on the achievement of his predecessors.  And build he did.

Gov. Aumentado built on the PEP of Gov. Rene by institutionalizing it although he renamed it to Bohol Poverty Reduction and Management Office (BPRMO) – a program that he carried out throughout his three terms as governor and before he bowed out of office, Bohol was declared insurgent-free.  But even before the declaration as insurgent-free, Pres. Gloria Maacapagal-Arroyo already issued an Administrative Order encouraging other local government units to follow the Bohol formula.  

The projects of BPRMO were implemented in 12 municipalities that had problems with the local communist insurgents.  All along it was an LGU-led program with the military on the very supportive role. But even with their supportive role, all the military commanders of the Philippine Army Brigades who were assigned to Bohol have all been promoted to Brigadier General even before they could be transferred to other areas of assignment, proving the effectiveness of the formula or strategy.

Gov. Edgar M. Chatto had relatively an easy going job of maintaining the insurgent-free status because of the program and the mechanism that were already in place when he took over as Governor of Bohol after Gov. Aumentado’s third and final term. This he did by installing the Countryside Development Program-Purok Power Movement (CDP-PPM).  His administration’s stumbling block to development and progress then was  no longer the CPP-NPA-NDF but the proliferation of illegal drugs in his administration which as of lately has accounted for 39,000 plus of illegal drug users and pushers who have surrendered to the authorities.

As previously discussed, the best antidote to insurgency is the presence of government in the barangays and communities to provide for their needs.  If people do not feel or see these, a vacuum is created, a situation that the cadres and political officers of the CPP-NPA can easily detect and thereby fill it up with their own programs and promises.

Happily this is the kind of presence that the people especially in the hinterlands of the 2nd Congressional district see in their present Representative to the Lower House of Congress.  In my going around the project sites of the Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project (INREMP) in the 2nd District, I always hear of people talk about their congressman personally frequenting their communities even when there are no official functions.  People talk about Cong. Aris’ health program that allows them to be treated in public hospitals without having to pay, or of residents in the island barangays being transported to the hospital or health centers for treatment for free and then being brought back to their homes.  That is the presence of government that we refer to that would keep the insurgents away from Bohol.

P.S. The Agora conveys its condolences and sympathies to Gov. Ed Chatto and his family on the passing away of his mother, who is fondly called Tiya Victoria.  Our prayers for the eternal repose of her soul with the Lord.
