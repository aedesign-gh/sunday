The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Oct. 8, 2017-Sunday) Matthew 18:21-35” For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. "When he had begun to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.

In Theology this is an endless forgiveness to be given to anyone because healing within begins in forgiving someone. The more hatred you possessed; the more wounds it creates in your heart. The looser is you if you do not know how to release the hatred in your heart. You need to cleanse your heart because it is the dwelling place of God and it is very shameful to stain it with our evil feelings. Let love reigns in your heart. Let peace governs your heart because it is a manifestation that God lives within you. He is God of love and peace. Love anyone and be an advocate of a peaceful living. Let God shines on you. You have given the talents from God to use it not for yourself but for the welfare of others. You need to help anyone discovered their talents also in life. The favors and blessings from God must be shared to your neighbors. Do not keep it because the real measure of your richness is not what you have owned, but to what you have given. Be good because God is very good to your life. Be a bridge of the love of God to anyone.

The more you experienced the goodness of God, supposedly, the more you let others experienced it also from you. Be an ambassador of God’s love and forgiveness. Be a living God in the society that you are in.
