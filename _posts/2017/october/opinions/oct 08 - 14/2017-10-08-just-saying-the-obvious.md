It no longer surprised us to hear that a cartel is behind the high prices of fuel and fish prices in Bohol.
After all these years, Boholanos deemed it normal to have high prices of gasoline products and fish supplies despite the fact that our seas are aplenty of fish.

Boholanos are already used to purchasing fuel products which is higher than P3 to P5 per liter compared to nearby provinces like Cebu.

This has been the scenario while we were still a staff member of the Bohol Chronicle and a reporter of Station DYRD more than two decades back.

The oil companies then, Shell, Petron and Caltex, moved like a cartel, operated like a cartel and made money like a cartel. But they are not saying that they were a cartel.

At that time, the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF) was already removed. The OPSF was a measure adopted by the Marcos regime where the government allocates money to subsidize oil price increases.

There was no problem when there was an oil price hike as the government will readily subsidize the increase.
But when the late Pres. Marcos was deposed, the OPSF was also deposed.

When Fidel V. Ramos became President, a law was enacted by Congress lifting any control of the government in the oil prices. This gave the cartel another opportunity to come in.

In Bohol, we were told that a price difference is expected due to the cost of transhipment of oil products from Batangas. We do not have any problem with that. But if the difference is already P3 to P5 per liter, there is already something else.

Former OIC Gov. Victor de la Serna once called for the filing of the appropriate criminal charges against the oil companies. Howsever, de la Serna’s call fell on deaf ears.

But what we cannot fathom is the high price of fish supplies in the local market.

As a college student in the city more than 30 years back, how can we forget that “tulingan” was sold at five centavos each.

Today, “tulingan” is sold at not less than P150 to P180 per kilo in the city central market. Oh my god.

It is a public knowledge that the seawaters of Bohol is aplenty with various schools of fish. It a God-given blessing to Boholanos to have abundant supply of fish and other sea foods.

But what in the hell that we have the high price of fish products in the local market nowadays.

We have been suspecting that a cartel is behind the high prices of fuel and fish products. 

At least for now, a high government official has finally said the obvious: that a cartel is really behind all these things.

Problem is how can we prove the existence of a cartel? That is a nice question to deal with.
