The raid by the military at one of the houses at the Muslim Village here in the city yielded high powered firearms. What is laudable here is that the residents showed that they are vigilant. They manifested that they are peace loving individuals whodo not want Tagbilaran would be like another Marawi city.

During the ASEAN Summit here there were English speaking Arabs who visited at one of the houses at the Muslim Village, but the neighbors were alert. They reported to their leaders who in turn reported to the city authorities. Those Arab visitors might by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a band of Syrian rebels supported by the NBI.

Like in Cabilao Island in Loon, the islanders were vigilant. They reported the presence of men who spoke strange sounding dialects. The residents were afraid that the men were out to kidnap foreign tourists vacationing in the island so they reported to the authorities who kept an eye of the movements of the strangers who ultimately went away since they sensed they were being followed. The men in Cabilao might be the men who encountered the military in Inabanga.

Thanks to counter terrorism program conducted by the authorities in Inabanga town, the people in the area were aware of the dangers of terrorism perpetrated by the (ISIS) which try to expand its reach in the Philippines. When the children of the area saw the strangers drying under the sun boxes and boxes of bullets and ammunitions, they told their parents who in turn reported to the police who kept it a secret from civilian authorities of Inabangaand immediately reported directly to the Provincial Commander.

The ISIS is different from the local NPAs. The ISIS are frustrated rebels who want to create an Islamic State all over the world. Their terrorism is their method and way for global attention. They do not hesitate to kill Christians because if they do, as they were promised that when they die together with their victims, they will go directly to heaven and be met by 27 virgins. 

The National Peopleâ€™s Army (NPA) which is the military arm of the National Democratic Front will not kill unless they are cornered. If they see military men in the area they will retreat to a safe place. They hate military encounters. All they want, and they will not rest and stop until their Communist Leader Jose Ma.Sison who is in exile in Netherland will become the president of the Philippines.

Let us be vigilant. We will not allow our peaceful and beautiful Bohol become like Marawi City because of foreign terrorist. If we meet in our purok some suspicious strangers coddled by our neighbors, we will not be hesitant to report them to the authorities.
