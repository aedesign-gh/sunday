A retribution?

In the teleserye100 Days to Heaven of  ABS-CBN, there was a pathetic scene there. It was of a birdâ€™s eye view shot of a father crying convulsively over the lifeless body of his child. What is painful there was that the father would have embraced his child, but he could not do it as his hands were bound behind his back. I congratulated the writer for that scene which touched the hearts of so many viewers. I wonder if that kind of scenario happened in real life. That episode reminds me of a crime some years back in a northern town of Tagbilaran. 

We could imagine the anguish and the pain of a father who works abroad for his family to learn that his lead majorette daughter was declared missing only to be found one year later that she was gang raped by the wealth-to-do guys of their town. Her school uniform and school ID gave way to her identity. Her bones were found under a heap of rotting banana leaves. It was a wonder nobody went to the place of the crime for a year.

Of course the culprits who were notable considering their family names which are stenciled on their fleet of public utility buses added by their good looks were putbehind bars. They would stay at the National Penitentiary for life.

Now the time of reckoning came. The child of the culprit who was still a toddler when he left grew into a tall, fine looking teenager just like his father. The doting grandparents gifted him an expensive motorcycle. Not long after, when he emerged from their gate straight to the street, without stopping to look at both directions if the coast was clear, he was bumped by their ownbus. He died on the spot at a young age.

You could imagine the anguish of the father inBilibid Prison who wanted to see for the last time his child who had grown up a fine child whom he had left as a toddler being lowered to the grave. But he was not allowed to come home.

The story is an example of retribution. The retribution might be from God. It reminds you the law in physics that in very action is an equal reaction.It also came to mind the time tested adage: Do not do unto others what you do not want others do unto you. Or the story of the two fathers is just a coincidence. 

The second father was put into prison as punishment for his misdeed by human court. Nature or it is God, who punished him by letting him feel how to feel losing a child. It is a sort of double punishment.
                     
It is now time to look deeper into the life of those in prison whose punishment are lifetime. Authorities must check their life if while they were in jail they had experienced some sort of tragic personal heart-breaking,  nerve wracking, mind blowing incidents involving their relatives that we can call a retribution by God for their crimes. If they do, their term in jail are to be cut short or they are to be freed as pardon or amnesty from the president of the Philippines. Freeing of prisoners had been a practice since time immemorial even by primitive society.

Prisoners who are sick, feebled by age must be freed to give their twilight years a happy one. They had already suffered so much for one single mistake. In this way, it will decongest the National Penitentiary and save the government of meal budget.
