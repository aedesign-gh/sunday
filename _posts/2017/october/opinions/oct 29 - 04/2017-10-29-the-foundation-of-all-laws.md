The foundation of all laws

30th Sunday of the Year(cycle A)
Readings:	Ex22:20-26; 1 Thes 1:5c-10; Mt22:34-40

During the time of Jesus, the Jews had made elaborate laws and regulations out of the original Ten Commandments.  These precepts numbered 613 thus classed: 365 (like the number of days in a year) were prohibitions and 248 (like members of the body) were actions to be done.  It was already so difficult to learn them, imagine what it was like to keep them.  In other part of the gospel, Jesus will refer to these precepts as “burdens that are unendurable.”

The religious guides of Israel taught that these commandments had all the same importance and were all equally binding, but there was disagreement as to which one was the first and the greatest of all.  When asked which of the 613 precepts was the greatest of all, Jesus gave a very interesting answer.

Instead of quoting only a particular precept, Jesus simply summarized everything into two basic laws – the love for God and the love for neighbor.  Jesus placed on the same level the love of God and the love of humans.  We all know what it means to love another human person, but how do we love God?

Many times this commandment was taken as “give God what is due to him”.  For instance: reserve for him the necessary time for the celebration on Sundays; then, before beginning your day, give some time to prayer and do the same in the evening; even during work raise your mind to God; then don’t miss out on other devotions like songs, processions, liturgical celebrations.  Does God really need to be honored like that?

The Jews also thought that “to love God” meant to offer him sacrifices and prayers, put at his disposal some money so that his name was made famous, acknowledged and respected among the largest number of pagans.  But isn’t there any other way of loving God?  If I am poor and then I want to go and visit a very rich family, I cannot simply approach them easily.  I have to choose some other way to prove my affection and respect.  I can for instance, pass some time with their children, joking, and playing with them, or telling them stories.

One thing is sure: if I succeed in making the children happy, I will make the parents happy also and show them my love.  The same thing is for God: we humans can reach him only through his children.  We can love him only by loving other people.  This is why Jesus joins together the two commandments.  A man who does love the brother that he can see cannot love God whom he has never seen.

We love God when we listen to his Word and live as he shows us.  Even prayer is not meant to give something to God, but to help us keep available and ready to do his will.

We may well say that here Jesus laid down the complete definition of religion.

Religion consists in loving God. The verse which Jesus quotes is Deuteronomy 6:5. That verse was part of the Shema, the basic and essential creed of Judaism, the sentence with which every Jewish service still opens, and the first text which every Jewish child commits to memory. It means that to God we must give a total love, a love which dominates our emotions, a love which directs our thoughts, and a love which is the dynamic of our actions. All religion starts with the love which is total commitment of life to God.

The second commandment which Jesus quotes comes from Leviticus 19:18. Our love for God must issue in love for men. But it is to be noted in which order the commandments come; it is love of God first, and love of man second. It is only when we love God that man becomes lovable. The Biblical teaching about man is not that man is a collection of chemical elements, not that man is part of the brute creation, but that man is made in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). It is for that reason that man is lovable. The true basis of all democracy is in fact the love of God. Take away the love of God and we can become angry at man the unteachable; we can become pessimistic about man the unimprovable; we can become callous to man the machine-minder. The love of man is firmly grounded in the love of God.

To be truly religious is to love God and to love the men whom God made in his own image; and to love God and man, not with a nebulous sentimentality, but with that total commitment which issues in devotion to God and practical service of men.
