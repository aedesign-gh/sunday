Fight before compromise

Our eagle eyes captured the perfect scenario tried to be projected by our kumpadre, Chito A. Fuentes, in his series on analysis of the Bohol incumbents.

Although we have to put up a different vantage point of his analysis, but the after effect is still just the same.

However, the approach of the Bohol incumbents is simply the common approach among lawyers, fight first before going into a compromise.

Our mole picked up the pieces of the broken photo tried to be assembled by our banner story this issue.

But there is one thing for sure in this political warfare, the Liberal Party (LP) and its allies are now trying to put up a one solid fight against Cabinet Sec. Leoncio “Jun” Evasco whom they perceived as the most tangible foe in the gubernatorial race in 2019.

The report said a planted reporter from Cebu tried to irk Evasco by aggressively asking for his comments about his gubernatorial plans.

This reportedly prompted Evasco to castigate the reporter. It turned out that this was the feedback made by a caller during a radio survey as to whom they prepare to run for governor.

The survey turned out to be paid by a gubernatorial wannabe. The connection between the reporter, the radio caller and the gubernatorial wannabe is crystal clear and as clear as the sun rises in the morning, except if there is a low pressure area.

It is now clear that the LP and its allies are preparing a fight against Evasco by resorting into dirty tactics and pin him down.

Well, it is the style of the present leaders that we have. But we know for a fact that they cannot survive fighting against Evasco. 

If they are indeed scheming politicians, we know that at the end of the tunnel is a potential compromise between their interests and the interest of Evasco who apparently is trying to copy the strategy of his boss, Pres. Duterte in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Though the local polls is still less than two years away, we will not be surprised if the LP and its allies will become flexible in their attack. This considering that they are no longer belong to the ruling party.
If they want to capitalize the membership of Cong. Art C. Yap to PDP-Laban, they may be in for a political surprise. 

We cannot say what is this surprise waiting for Yap and his allies with LP. Otherwise, it is no longer a surprise.

It can be within the ruling party or from outside the party considering that Rep. Aris C. Aumentado is now at his lonesome at the Nationalist Peoples Coalition (NPC).

As our good friend, Atty. Salvador Diputado, who is now the regional director of the Department of Agriculture in Region 8, would love to end his column: stay tuned.
