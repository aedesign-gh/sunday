Sometimes we blame God 
 
The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Oct.29, 2017- Sunday)Luke 19:45-48-And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, and could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.Is it your habit to respect to anything and to anyone? Do you value respect in your life? God respects you all the times. God wants you also to do the same. Being respectful is a manifestation of being careful to the emotion of others.

Take note, every disrespect that you have done; there is someone who is touched and hurt if not human, I know our God the creator of everything. This gospel emphasizes about the physical temple and its structure which was “desecrated” by the Jewish people. Jesus opposed to them since it was an act of blasphemy and irreverence to the holy place. On the other hand, Jesus taught them about the real temple which is his body. Look, what they had done to the earthly sanctuary, it was a “real” reflection to what they did to Him, the genuine temple. This was the ground of Jesus why He condemned the blasphemers and casted out from the temple. How about us, how many times we desecrated the temple of God? Everything we intake in our bodies can either produce double results, bad or good. You need to take only what is helpful because you are accountable to the damage of your physical body. Sometimes we blame God but actually, it is our faults to be sick.Proverbs 19:3”The foolishness of man ruins his way, and his heart rages against the LORD. Take note, Jesus was a daily worshipper to God. According to Proverbs 8:34-"Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates. Therefore, come to God always for you to be happy. To come to God daily at his temple is looking backward to the followers of Jesus in the past. In Acts2:44-46” they gathered daily at the temple and ate the body of Jesus through the Eucharist or breaking of the bread. This is not followed by the majority since we come to the mass every Sunday only. If this is practice by the people, we can expect more good people.
