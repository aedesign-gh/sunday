Keep the boats off the shores of Panglao when not in use

In less than a year Bohol was host to three (3) ASEAN activities all held in the province’s tourism jewel that is PanglaoIsland.  During those three occasions, the latest of which was two weeks ago, the Alona shores and the sea that extends up to Pamilacan and Balicasag Islands were ‘spic and span,’ cleared of motor boats an bancas that made this jewel island looked like it was soaked in mud any time of the day and night.  A keen observer would think, Panglao was being invaded by Spartacus upon seeing those boats anchored on the shores of Alona in Brgy. Tawala up to the shores of Brgy. Danao.

If our beaches and shores could be cleared of eye sores during an ASEAN activity, it means that it can be done after all.  So why couldn’t it be done every day of Panglao’s life?  Let it be a daily routine.  If the purpose of doing it during the ASEAN activity was for the security and safety of the ASEAN delegates, then let it be for beauty and orderliness this time.

Panglao will become more attractive to tourists and visitors without those unsightly boats and bancas.  I am not saying we get rid of the business.  We only get rid of the unsightly view of our shores filled with those boats by putting them in one place like a municipal marina where they can be safely anchored without destroying marine life.  All that is needed is a good design and budget.  Then the municipality will have an economic enterprise that will earn additional income to fund other social and economic programs and projects.

This writer is not the only one who called attention to this gap or issue in the tourism program of Panglao, in particular, and the province in general.  But even the provincial government,through theProvincial Tourism Council (PTC),has failed to address it, making people to wonder why a problem that could be addressed by a simple ordinance regulating the area for parking those boats while waiting for clients has not been done yet.  Or perhaps the PTC and the municipal government of Panglao don’t consider it an issue or a problem at all, in which case I rest my pen.

It may not be a surprise, though, because up to this time, if my information is correct,the Sangguniang Bayan of Panglao has not even passed an ordinance that would adopt the guidelines used by the then Review and Development Committee (REDCOM) for all tourism related facilities and establishments in Panglao.  That would have partly addressed the problem.  That piece of legislation has been under consideration for almost a decade already.  It would have easily facilitated action on the application for the construction of a 12-storey building now pending at the building official’s office.

Last Friday I brought my graduate school students in local government administration to interview Mayor Nila Montero and her treasurer, planning and development officer, and budget officer on their sources for income generation besides the traditional sources of taxes and internal revenue allotment or IRA. The interview was made possible by Victor Lapiz, the municipal local government operations officer of DILG in Panglao.

From the local sources of income of Panglao, it could easily rise to qualify as a first class municipality but they are not in a hurry.  There is just so much opportunity to increase income, what with all the tourism businesses now operating in Panglao.  More than 60% of the accommodation rooms in Bohol are in Panglao.  The New Bohol Airport in Panglao is targeted to be operational in June 2018. The environment for income generation is favourable.  All Panglaoneeds is a comprehensive plan and the political will to implement it. 

Economic enterprise is among those enumerated in the Local Government Code that could be a vehicle for increasing incomes for local governments.  This opportunity is now present in Panglao.  But for now it has only a market building and a water system to speak of.  With the dynamic leadership of Mayor Nila Montero, we want to see Panglao’s march to first class municipality much faster in the coming year.

But first, Mayor Nila let’s get those boats off the shores of Alona in Brgy. Tawala and Danao when they are not in use. A municipal marina where they can be anchored can be a good economic enterprise for the municipal government.

NOTES. We will have a long holiday to allow people to remember and visit their departed family members and friends where they have been interred while awaiting resurrection.  We hope authorities have fully prepared to keep our cemeteries safe for the living.   Definitely traffic will be terrible and parking spaces difficult to find.But since when was it easy on occasions like this?  Whatever it is, the greetings is still HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!
