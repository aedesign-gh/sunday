When something goes wrong and it becomes widespread, people usually run to the government for help or for solution.  But what happens when government has no answer nor solution or even just an explanation that can be well appreciated, understood and accepted by the public?  Then it becomes really fishy and people might look for the answer or solution somewhere else.  That is the worst that can happen.

That is what is can happen with the price of fish in Bohol.  For a province that is an island, surrounded by seawaters and where almost all coastal residents are engaged in fishing, theprice of fish here is more than what we can imagine.  How can a tulingan that used to command only a price of P50 a kilo now be priced at P150 or P170?  Just like the galunggong, the tulinganis considered the poor man’s fish.  But now even those who have more than P50 to spare for a kilo of fish are also now complaining.

In fact the skyrocketing prices of fish in Bohol have become viral among netizens and a favorite subject for discussion among ordinary citizens who have only access to the radio and newspapers.  The complaints have piled up so much so that even the SangguniangPanlalawigan has now seen the propriety of conducting an inquiry or investigation in aid of legislation.

This is not, of course, the first time that people have become vocal about the unreasonable increase in the price of fish in the markets in Bohol.  The problem already cropped up years back but died down when government found a band aid solution.  Band aid because it did not last long before the prices soared again beyond the capability of the small and marginalized Boholanos.  This time the rich in resources have started to feel the pinch and they, too, joined the bandwagon, so to speak.  With the influential now joining the campaign against the high prices of fish, local government had to act swiftly.

Alongside the legislative inquiry and investigation, the provincial agriculture office headed by officer-in-charge Larry Pamugas mobilized the farmer’s groups to organize themselves into cooperatives if only to plug the whole in the fishing industry.

Accordingly local and small fishermen sell their catch to businessmen in Cebu that buy all their catch and they need not peddle their catch anymore.  In turn these Cebu businessmen sell the fish they buy from Bohol fishermen to the Boholanos, this time at higher prices.  It must be noted of course that even before the fish can leave the boat of the fisherman, it must pass through layers of middlemen before it could reach the businessman.  So, too, when the fish is brought back to the Bohol markets.  It is in these layers where price increases take place because one middleman must earn his profits.

Recently this explanation about why the prices have gone up was a bit muddled with the statement of the Cooperatives Development Authority Administrator BenjieOliva, himself a Boholano, when he claimed that the high prices of fish in Bohol is caused by fish cartel.  This has triggered an intense debate among government functionaries of the different agencies and even ordinary people whose voices were given an avenue by the broadcast media.  Now they would like AdministratorOliva to amplify some more his statement and to name the names of those in the cartel.  Even the committee of the SangguniangPanlalawigan making the inquiry and investigation would now want Oliva to appear before the committee.

Let’s hope this inquiry and investigation will lead to the real cause of the high prices of fish and will not be another band aid action or ningas cogon.  Now that it is the SanggunianagPanlalawigan that is making the inquiry, let us expect there will be a legislation that will come out to address the problem.

All we ask is that we be given a win-win solution that consumers and businessmen can both happily accept.
