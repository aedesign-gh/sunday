The SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol correctly went into work by investigating on the alleged cartel behind the fish trade in the province.

The committee on agriculture chaired by Board Member AbeleonDamalerio started the probe on the alleged cartel allegedly operating here thereby jeopardizing the fish prices in the local market.

Apparently, almost all the local newspapers last week bannered the claims of BenjieSoliva of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) that a cartel is behind the high prices of fish supply in Bohol.

Among those invited were Leo Bongalos of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) who told the committee hearing that there’s no such thing as fish cartel here.

Bongalos said that it may be hard to prove the existence of a cartel which was alleged behind the high prices of fish and also of the fuel products sold by local gasoline stations.

The position of Bongalos was supported by Larry Pamugas of the provincial agriculture office.

What we cannot fathom is the fact that indeed a cartel is operating behind the fuel and fish trade in Bohol. We thank Oliva for saying the obvious but what is incomprehensible is the fact that our concerned government agencies seem to like deaf and dumb over the operation of a cartel.

The statement of BongalosasndPamugas practically put a cold water in the boiling issue claimed by Olivawho was reported as saying that fish cartel is indeed manipulating prices of fish and fuel.

However when pressed if he identifies some cartel members, Oliva however declined and neither gave details how these cartels work for raking profits from petroleum and fish products they sell.

He added that the government should investigate cartel allegedly manipulating the prices of fish or marine products.

Veteran lawmaker Board Member Tomas D. Abapo, Jr. thinks otherwise and hinted on the existence of a fish cartel here.

He defined cartel as “a group of people who agree to fix prices” of certain commodities, like fish, rice or copra. “It is the buyer who fixes the prices,” he told the committee meeting.

The provincial board is trying, for the nth time, to look into the high prices of fish in the province after Abapo brought up to the attention of his colleagues the issue of high fish prices in Bohol.

Damalerio’s committee is contemplating to invite Oliva in separate committee meeting soon.

As we can predict, the committee investigation is going nowhere. So we come up with the this proposal as a matter of an obiter dictum.

The provincial board should come up with a resolution calling for the creation of a special investigating body to look into this alleged cartel manipulating our fuel and fish products in Bohol.

The body must include the participation of the National Bureau of Investigation, the Provincial Attorneys Office, the PNP Maritime Police among others so that we can see a light at the end of the tunnel.
