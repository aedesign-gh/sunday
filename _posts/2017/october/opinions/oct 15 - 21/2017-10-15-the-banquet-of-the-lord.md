28th Sunday of the Year(cycle A)
Readings:	Is25:6-10a; Phil4:12-14, 19-20; Mt22:1-14

We Filipinos are meal oriented people.  We like feasts.  We love to gather around with all the food we can bring.  However, food and drinks may not be enough for us.  We have programs, dances, singing, games, and much more.  In other words, Filipinos love banquets.

It would not be difficult for us today to relate with our theme of our readings since they all speak of a banquet.

In the first reading from the prophet Isaiah we are told that God will one day prepare a banquet.  God, the prophet says, is like a great king: he wants to celebrate a great victory, and for this he is preparing a great and splendid feast, a banquet worthy of a great sovereign like him.  It will be a banquet of rich food, of fine wines, of every tye of tasty meat.

In our Gospel today, we heard Jesus speaking of a parable of the wedding banquet.  But before going any further let us first understand the context.  In ancient times, kings announced the approximate time for a wedding banquet weeks in advance.  The exact date of the banquet was given at a later date.  To say yes to the advance invitation and no at the later date was an insult.

Take this illustration.  Suppose your son is returning home after being out of the country for many years.  He is scheduled to arrive sometime next week, but he is not sure whether it will be on Thursday or Friday.  You call two of his closest friends and invite them to a welcome dinner.  You explain the situation and asked them to hold both dates open.  They agree enthusiastically.  When news comes that your son will arrive on Friday, you call his friends back and say, “The dinner will be Friday night.”  They shock you by saying, “Sorry! We’ve made other plans for that night.”

It was this kind of situation that Jesus had in mind in today’s parable.

The audience for whom Jesus intended the parable was the Jews of his time.  Ages before, they had accepted God’s invitation to be his chosen people – his special guests at the banquet of the Kingdom of God.  But when Jesus came to announce the banquet, they rejected his invitation.

It is clear how Jesus’ parable applied to the Jews of his day.  But how does it apply to us today?  What message does it contain for us at this present time?

The Jews had accepted God’s first invitation.  But then some of them had a change of heart.  The parable says one man decided to work on his farm instead.  Another decided to attend to other business.  These men did not go off to get drunk.  They did not decide to commit a crime.  They simply decided to do something else.

Here is the lesson for us.  We, too, have accepted God’s invitation.  We accepted baptism and confirmation.  We said “yes” to God’s invitation to be his guests at the eternal banquet.

But saying yes to God’s invitation is not a one-time commitment.  It is an on-going process.  Saying yes to God’s invitation requires constant recommitment and updating.  It is so easy to get distracted by daily life and to forget about eternal life.  It is so easy to fill ourselves with the junk food of this life and forget about the banquet of eternal life.

Accepting God’s invitation is not a matter of saying yes once then forgetting all about it.  It is like the “I do” of marriage.  The “I do” is not the end process, but the beginning of one.  Saying yes to God is like graduating from college.  Graduation is not the end of one’s learning, but the launching pad for further learning.

Our commitment to God must grow too.  If it does not, it can die, like an unused muscle.
