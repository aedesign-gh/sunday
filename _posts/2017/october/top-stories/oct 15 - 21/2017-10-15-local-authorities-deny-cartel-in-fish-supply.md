Allegations that a cartel exists and is being blamed for manipulating prices of fish catch in Bohol is disputed mostly by government officials.

Leo Bongalos of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) told agriculture committee hearing last week chaired by Board Member Abeleon Damalerio that there’s no such thing as fish cartel here.

He added that it may be hard to prove the existence of a cartel. His notion of fish cartel is supported by Larry Pamugas of the provincial agricultures office.

Both apparently reacted to Benjie Oliva of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) who claimed that fish prices in Bohol are controlled by a cartel.

In recent interview with media, Oliva said that fish cartel is indeed manipulating prices of fish without giving concrete proof.

When pressed if he identifies some cartel members, he declined and neither gave details how these cartels work for raking profits from petroleum and fish products they sell.

He added that the government should investigate cartel allegedly manipulating the prices of fish or marine products.

But Board Member Tomas D. Abapo, Jr. thinks otherwise and hinted on the existence of a fish cartel here.
He defined cartel as “a group of people who agree to fix prices” of certain commodities, like fish, rice or copra. “It is the buyer who fixes the prices,” he told the committee meeting.

The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Bohol is trying, for the nth time, to look into the high prices of fish in the province after Abapo brought up to the attention of his colleagues the issue of high fish prices in Bohol.
Damalerio’s committee is contemplating to invite Oliva in separate committee meeting soon. (with reports from Ric V. Obedencio)
