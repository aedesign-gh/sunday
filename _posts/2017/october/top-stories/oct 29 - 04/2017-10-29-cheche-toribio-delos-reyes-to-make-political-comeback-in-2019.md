CARMEN. – “It’s in my heart.”

This is how she described her intention to run for congresswoman, again, in the third district where her hometown Carmen belongs.

This writer was able to interview her exclusively last Friday night despite her hectic schedule attending to her business and the sloppy cell phone signal.

A supporter said that the former Carmen mayor may have a big chance in 2019 local elections considering that the field is already level when incumbent Cong. Arthurs C. Yap exits on June 30, 2019.

Other political observers also agree and that Delos Reyes might be the strong contender to the third district congressional race.

The post is to be vacated by Yap who is reportedly eyeing to gun for governor with last-termer Rep. Rene Relampagos probably his running-mate (for vice-governor).

If she’s lucky in 2019, she would be the first congresswoman in the third district, the observers said.
Her bid for governor in 2013 and congresswoman in 2016 may not be as good as her winning hands down in mayoralty race in her hometown in 2010.

Cabinet Sec. Leoncio visited her days after her birthday recently. (rvo)
