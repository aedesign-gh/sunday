The provincial government of Bohol is eyeing for a P2.9-billion annual provincial budget for 2018 and has in fact submitted it to the SangguniangPanlalawigan of Bohol.

Atty. John Mitchel Boiser,acting Provincial Administrator and Provincial Legal Officer said the budget proposal was submitted on Oct. 13 and set to be relayed to the SP’s committee on appropriations.

In the previous week, representatives from Capitol offices including hospitals and other establishments run by the provincial government conducted a series of budget hearings to draw up the proposal. 

For his part, Board Member AbeleonDamalerio who chairs the SP’s budget and appropriations committee said that the provincial legislative body has yet to tackle the proposed 2018 allotment. 

Two months before yearend, Damalerio noted that the proposal has not yet been reviewed as this has not reached his committee.

Last year, the SP approved the provincial government’s proposed P2.3 billion budget for this year.
