**‘JardinNecitas’**
glows smoothly
 
PILAR.- “There is no a gift better than the one that is made by hands,” a writer said.
The same can be said about flowers, which “they decorate our life, make it more colored and bright.”
This maybe drove the Cubrado family to put up JardinNecitas of glowing LED-laced plastic flowers aside from plain business, Ms. Vanessa Cubrado, gorgeous daughter of the firs family and brain of this project said in gist.
She said in interview that JardinNecitas is now having some 15,000 tulips and 5,000 roses of various colors that glow when switched on during night time.
But that’s all of it since some development are under way, like setting up a swimming pool with spring water abundant and restaurant nearby more than 20 hectares of mango plantation property owned and managed by the family.
The family just inaugurated the JardinNecitas, named after her mother Necitas, incumbent mayor of Pilar town, on September 27, 2017.
It looks like it’s becoming the new magnet as can be shown in hundreds of people from afar flocking the place located at purok 5, barangay Bagumbayan of this town during its opening day.
Provincial Board Member Alexie Tutor said in short message this may set a trend during the blessing fortunately falls on September 27, 2017, the International Tourism Day.
Tagbilaran City Councilor JojoBompat, apparently representing City Mayor Baba Yap, who was invited but failed to come, also expressed his appreciation to Cubrado family for the enterprising multi-million venture, probably the first of its kind in the province.
Anda town Mayor Angelina “Inday” Simacio came in with some friends to see for themselves the new craze in town.
“TO MAYOR NECITAS CUBRADO, Vanessa and the whole Cubrado Family for this great Innovation to put Pilar in the Tourism Map of Bohol. This will also boost the Economy in Pilar. More Power and God bless your Business Empire,” policewoman Melinda Basalo said on her fb post.
“Congrats mayor classmate Nita and to Cubrado family bringing tourist distination to Pilar town and Bohol province as well. Gd luck,” another fb user Susana TapdasanRomana said.
This town, where farmers enjoying the riches of nature providing them with water thru Malinao dam for irrigation and fertile land, has grown from its poor beginnings.
 
Pilarnons are proud of its potentials in history, culture and natural resources, which the townsfolk have developed with strong cooperation among themselves, Mayor Cubrado once said.  
Venture out of your homes now to JardinNecitas to see nature’s gift of green landscapes in JardinNecitas against the backdrop of mountain ranges of Ubay and Mabini towns in the east and Dagohoy in the west. (rvo)
