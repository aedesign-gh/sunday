We tried to answer that question by ourselves for the past few months and we can find many reason why.

Is there a jinx when we described a place to be insurgency-related? Apparently there is none.
Ah, it will perhaps affect the tourism industry in Bohol. But apparently, it aggravated the incursion of the Abu Sayyaf bandit group believing that doing their atrocities with the foreign tourist here will raise their ante and ransom target.

Look what happened to the entry of 10 members of ASG early this year. Our over-eagerness to host the ASEAN meetings apparently attracted the bandit group to extend its kidnapping operations here using one of the locals in Napo, Inabanga.

We cannot understand the reason why Brig. Gen. Arnulfo Matanguihan, 302nd Brigade commander of the Philippine Army, stood pat on his decision to continue verifying the alleged armed hostilities of the underground movement over the past couple of months.

Apparently, Matanguihan is resorting to some sort of dilly-dallying in order to die down the issue.

But manifestations of the rebel movement for the past couple of months have become more prevalent. Denials on the return of insurgency in Bohol will not bring any solution to the problem at hand.

Accepting the return of the New Peopleâ€™s Army (NPA) in Bohol cannot diminish the integrity of the government forces here. In fact, it could be utilized to demand for more capabilities of its armaments, capability and personnel.

The latin maxim, sivispacem, para bellum, will simply remind our military and government officials here that if you want peace, then prepare for war. 

But what could easily brought to our mind is the fact that once the military will accept the return of the communist rebels in the province is an admission that the Countryside Development Program (CDP) Purok Power Movement is a failure.

This could then break loose as far as the provincial government is concerned. The Capitol has allocated millions of funds for this project, many women have been impregnated due to the coordination of the civilian employees and the Army personnel, so much meetings and trainings for the past years.

That was one hell of expenses as far as the government is concerned only to find out that it was a failure? No, the provincial government, the Army and even the police cannot accept that.

Practically, there were reports that some top Capitol honchos were laughing their way to the bank but that remains to be proven.

The fact is, we have to confront the issue of insurgency face to face. No more denials, no diversionary tactic.

Why not admit the fact that Bohol is no longer insurgency-free. It will take a kilometric word to say amen.
