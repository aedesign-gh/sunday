I could not help sharing with my dear readers this story:

AJ is a three year old daughter of my nephew. She is not in school yet considering her age.
Last week her father left her alone in their bedroom while playing with her tablet.

When he came back he was surprised to see AJ defecating at the clump of bananas beside the house. Her father asked why she defecated there.

AJ relate this story:

She went out of the room and said : Jesus “yayay” (painful) ako tummy. 

Then Jesus appeared and said: Ou, ou, (defecate) kaw and guide her to the side of the house. While she was defecating Jesus squatted a few feet away from her and watched over her.

AJ told his father: NagkadugosiJesus , Pa. Dakosamadiyaani, she touched her right ribs. Daghansamadiyatuhod, hasta iyakamot.

“Daghantunoktunokiyaani,” as she touched her brow.

AJ said Jesus had a long hair and wore green and pink attire.

All of us interrogated her. She was consistent with her reply even if we reversed the questions again and repeatedly. Her answers did not change.

We are sure AJ had not heard the story of Jesus as no one of us had told her the story of Jesus.

She could not fabricate the wounds of Christ because we do not have pictures of the wounded Christ in our house.

Perhaps a child has a keener perception of intangible things than most of us adult.

The child’s story made this writer firmly believe that Jesus Christ is just within our midst and always ready to help us in times of need.
