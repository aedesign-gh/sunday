DU30’s revolutionary government

We better watch and the Yellowtards better not cry as the call to establish a revolutionary government is all set on Nov. 30, Bonifacio Day.

Both Pres. Duterte and the Malacanang Palace downplayed the call for the  establishment of a revolutionary government but the KilusangPagbabago, the Young Officers Union (YOU), the Guardians and the Duterte Diehard Supporters (DDS) are moving heaven and earth in order to materialize a mass movement on Thursday and reach the target of mobilizing 10 million via live streaming.

Perhaps sensing that a revolutionary government is coming, a few Yellowtards and the Opposition started to mobilize small street protests opposing the revolutionary government in Manila.

There is nothing to fear about a revolutionary government as espoused by Pres. Duterte. It is just a repeat of the revolutionary government of former Pres. Cory Aquino in 1986.

Although the movement should come outside of the government institution as it partakes of an extra-constitutional means of effecting the much awaited change.

Those who joined the movement calling for a revolutionary government admitted that the shift from presidential to federal form of government will not be materialized if we go through the constitutional means of changing the fundamental law of the land.

If Congress will have to be relied in the shift of government, it will never be realized as the politicians are definitely against federalism. 

Though one cannot fathom why we did not adopt the federal form of government when we copied almost all the characteristics and features of the American government.

We believe that Pres. Duterte’s declaration of a revolutionary government will be the short cut in order to arrive at the main objective of federalism.

The crafting of a new constitution providing for the federal form of government will just be a re-enactment of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which was framed by a Constitutional Commission and ratified in a plebiscite. 

Although there are some birth pangs of a revolutionary government. For one, all elected government positions will be considered vacant until the adoption of a new constitution and the election by state under a federal set-up. In the interregnum, the writ of habeas corpus will be suspended giving way to the arrest of the drug lords, narco-politicians and the corrupt politicians.

We cannot see any reason why the promise of change campaigned by Duterte will not be realized through a revolutionary government, that is against drug addiction, corruption and the shift to a federal government.

So let’s see whether this revolutionary government will be realized come Nov. 30, Bonifacio Day.
