Ernesto Abella out, lawyer Harry Roque in.

It's as simple as that, but critics of the Duterte administration just wouldn't allow even a simple substitution to pass without criticism.

The most notable among them came from Rep. EdcelLagman. Notable not because of Lagman's stature - because he has long ceased to be rational when it comes to the President - but because the anti-Duterte media is quick to give him space for obvious reasons.

Lagman said Roque "failed to criticize Duterte's predisposition to authoritarian rule and intention to declare a revolutionary government".

This "failure" of course, is a requirement that exists only in Lagman's perverted state of mind that he shares with all those who miss the glory days of the disgraced and unlamented Liberal Party.

So what if President Rodrigo Duterte feels it is time to go tit-for-tat with blabbermouths like Lagman? Is there a law against it?

So what if President Duterte decides to appoint Abella to another position that he feels the latter is best suited to?

What Duterte's critics conveniently gloss over is the fact that presidential appointees serve at his pleasure.

It is his sole prerogative, not one that requires Lagman's or any similar-minded obstructionist's opinion much less concurrence.

The President is known to think outside the box. When he was still Davao mayor, he appointed his trusted lieutenant, now Cabinet Secretary LeoncioEvasco, OIC of the city engineer's department.

It is the same genius that promoted lawyer Jesus Clint Aranas president and general manager of GSIS in the process allowing Dr. Francisco Duque to return to the Department of Health. 

Who else could have thought of that?

One significant thing in this development was that Abella was replaced not because he was facing corruption issues like former DILG Secretary Ismael Sueno or conflict of interest like the recently resigned SSS officials.

It is also unfair to blame Abella for the slight drop in Duterte's ratings - which was not really significant as the Social Weather Station survey made it appear. 

The loyal pastor that he is, Abella reportedly asked if he may leave government service but the answer was no.

The point is that if there is anybody who wants this administration, and this country to succeed, it is Duterte.

If he has to tweak his Cabinet and his line-up again to make this country great again, trust Duterte to do that - in his time. 

In the words of New York Times columnist Charles Blow: there is no wrong time to do the right thing.
