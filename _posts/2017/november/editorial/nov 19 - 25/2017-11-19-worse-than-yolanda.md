Four years after typhoon Yolanda devastated Tacloban City and all the other places along its path, there is still no closure.

For one, the construction of the shelters supposed to rise in place of those that were blown away by the strongest typhoon then that ever hit land still has a long way to go.

When Pres.Duterte visited Tacloban last year, his first as president, he did not hide his disgust over the snail-paced work.

The delay is not so much because of incompetence, although that was a constant characteristic in nearly all agencies under the Aquino administration.

It was much deeper and ugly than that.

The stories of how major players during the time of ex-Pres.Noynoy Aquino struck gold in the worst calamity in the nation's history just won't die.

It's simply mind-boggling how people (at least they look like people) could be worse than animals, feeding on the carcasses like it was the most normal thing to do.

And guess what? They still have the temerity to call themselves disente. Can you beat that?

The worst people (if you can still call them people) are those who take advantage of the suffering ravaged by tragedy and misery.

The least that one can do for a suffering soul is to offer words of comfort. The best is to pray for them and at the same time do what is within one's means to somehow alleviate the suffering.

But take advantage of them by diverting the funds intended for their relief and rehabilitation for personal aggrandizement? Can anyone be worse than that?

As to why no case has been filed against those responsible for this shameless robbery, blame it on the prosecution arms not only of the past administration but also of the present.

The past, we can do little about that.

But the present? It's utterly frustrating and disappointing.

With the passing of the years, it would be too much to expect anybody to call for the prosecution of the guilty to gain ground.

Alleged victims of the war against drugs, yes. You hear about them massing at every opportunity and excuse - many times inside the hallowed confines of churches - by those who demonize a president who took it upon himself to clean the litters he inherited.

(Isn't it a mystery that drug and crime syndicates are quiet when they are the ones hit most by this war? They don't have to because the disentes are fighting the war for them.)

The international name for Yolanda was Haiyan. Sounds like the Tagalog hayaan(let it be).

Are we just going to let this most obscene of lootings to go unpunished? Hayaannalang?

If there is anything worse than Yolanda, this is it. And looks like we will just let it be...
