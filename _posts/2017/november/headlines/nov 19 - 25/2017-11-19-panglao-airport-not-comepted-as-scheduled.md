Panglao airport insider: project unfinished as set

Despite the entry of the Duterte administration in the construction of a new airport in Panglao town, the project may still end up being delayed in its scheduled completion next year, reports reaching the Bohol Sunday News yesterday said.

An insider of the Panglao airport project made the disclosure when exclusively interviewed by this paper in a high end restaurant this city yesterday noon. 

The source, who requested anonymity, is part of the Panglao airport construction, revealed that the project is still half of its completion and cannot be finished as scheduled in June of 2018.

The airport cannot also be commercially operational by August next year despite the assurance of Sec. Art Tugade of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) who made an inspection last week together with National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) Sec. Ernesto Pernia and Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco.

The source said that among the causes of the delay are the supplies of aggregates which has been controlled by top honchos of the provincial government. Aggravating the situation is the failure of the contractor to put up a landing pier of supplies in one of the beaches in Panglao town.

Dump trucks from the city port will carrying the aggregates and other supplies has to pass by the main road from Tagbilaran to Panglao.

Secondly, the land acquisition of the project has been very much delayed. One of the families affected by land acquisition are the Bonggots who were harassed by authorities just to leave the land occupied by the new airport.

The source also added that the project cannot be finished by June next year if the aggregate supplies will still be under the control of top Capitol officials.
But Tugade in his site inspection of the Bohol Panglao International Airport last week expressed confidence that construction of the facility will be completed in June next year.

Tugade, who visited the P7.8-billion airport, said that construction is now “55 percent” complete although continued rains have slightly slackened progress.
But the BSN source said the project status is less than 50% yet.

Tugade told local media that the international airport in the resort town of Panglao will be one of the country’s “best airports” once completed.

He cited the advantage of the Bohol Panglao International Airport since it has already space for further expansion.

Congestion problems encountered in most airports in the country will be done away with at the Panglao facility due to the vast area procured by the government, he said.

The Panglao airport was designed to have six passenger boarding bridges, or tubes, while its runway will be 2.5 km long once completed.

According to Tugade, the runway—1,800 m of which is already paved—is expected to be completed before yearend while the passenger terminal is slated for completion in February next year.

The runway has also been set for expansion even prior to its completion as an additional 300-meter segment will be added to extend it to 2,800 meters after the airport is already operational.

This will allow the facility to accommodate aircraft used for transpacific and transatlantic flights, said the DOTr secretary.

Tugade and his party arrived the other Tuesday on board a small private aircraft testing the fully paved segment of the Panglao runway for the first time.

They were met among others by Gov. Edgar M. Chatto, City Mayor Baba Yap and Vice Mayor Pedro Fuertes of Panglao town.
