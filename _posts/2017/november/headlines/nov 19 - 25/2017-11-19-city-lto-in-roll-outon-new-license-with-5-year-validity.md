The regional office of the Land Transportation Office (LTO) announced last week the inclusion of the LTO office in the city as among the roll-out of driver’s license with five-year validity.

In an advisory sent to the local media outlets here, LTO Region VII said it has started installing the computers with its peripherals for the printing of the driver’s license card with 5-year validity covering 19 officesregion wide.

The new designed driver’s license card has a biometric system - fingerprint and face capturing. 

Thus, clients have to come personally to the LTO office where they got their license for the enrolment in the biometric - fingerprinting (10 fingers) and photo taking. 

Blood type is an additional information that must be encoded to the system.
However, the LTO regional office is still awaiting the installation of internet connection with higher mbps (min 15 max 100) by PLDT and Globe. 

As of Nov. 10, PLDT has installed in four offices. Both PLDT and Globe assured the LTO regional office that they can install in due time.

As soon as the following offices (Mandaue City, Cebu City, DLRO SM City, Talisay City, LapuLapu City, Tagbilaran City, Dumaguete City and Dumaguete City) with high volume of transactions (backlog plus current) will be installed with the required mbps, LOT will immediately schedule the roll-out then printing and releasing will commence.

Since there are offices with lesser volume but was already installed with the required mbps, then LTO will include those in the first batch.

The agency will announce the roll-out through triand social media in the next few days.
