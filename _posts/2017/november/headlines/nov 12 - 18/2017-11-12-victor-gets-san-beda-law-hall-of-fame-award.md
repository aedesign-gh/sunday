“Sic transit gloria mundi” (thus passes the glory of the world), thus exclaimed Atty. Victor S. de la Serna upon being notified last week that he has been elevated to the Hall of Fame of the San Beda Law in Manila.
The former OIC governor of Bohol belongs to Class 65 of San Beda College of Law and later topped the bar examinations that year.

De la Serna is one of the two living members of the 1972 Constitution Convention representing the first district of Bohol together with Chito Castillo of Loon.

The 1972 Constitutional Convention was headed by the late Pres. Carlos P. Garcia who died after delivering his inaugural speech entitled “SursumCorda”.

But de la Serna was again called to active duty in order to amend the 1987 Philippine and change the system of government from presidential to federal.

De la Serna was named as one of the 25-member Constitutional Commission formed by Pres. Duterte.

When interviewed by the Bohol Sunday News yesterday noon, de la Serna said he will personally receive the award on Nov. 24at Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati City in just in time for the gathering of the Constitution Commission either in the last week of this month or in the first week of December this year.

He said that this will be his last contribution to the Filipino people.

The award given to de la Serna by the San Beda Law is the highest recognition given by the San Beda Law Alumni Association (SBLAA) to Bedans who left an important legacy to the professional sector through their unceasing passion for the service, thus becoming a source of great pride and inspiration to the Bedan Community and the Filipino race.

De la Serna is considered as a Presidential Adviser to Pres. Duterte who was once his student in the College of Law of San Beda College. Duterte personally visited the residence of de la Serna during the presidential campaign in 2016 and has officially invited him to Malacanang last October in 2016.

During the interview with this paper, de la Serna quoted a line by Etienne de Grellet, a Quaker Missionary,by saying that “I shall pass this way but once, any good that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.”
