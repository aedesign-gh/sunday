The committee on good government was tasked last Friday by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Bohol to look into the complaint filed by a town kagawad against his fellow kagawad in Jagna town.

On top of the presiding officer’s time during the regular session last Friday is the letter-complaintof Kag, Edesel R. Tutor  against his fellow councilor, Kag. Maricris V. Jamora.

Tutor is charging Jamora for violation of the provisions of the Ethical Code of Conduct of Government Officials and Employees (R.A. 6713) which is similar to acts of unbecoming of a public officer.

Board Member Abeleon Damalerio chairs the committee on good governance of the provincial board.

It is expected that a committee meeting will be called by Damalerio next week to be attended by Tutor and Jamora together with their witnesses.

The case stemmed from an incident last Oct. 6. Inside the municipal hall of Jagna town where a budget hearing was held.

According to the blotter of the Jagna police station, Jamora allegedly “got wild” while inside the town hall at around noontime last Oct. 6 and clawed Tutor’s left ear which caused injuries due to the force and Jamora’s fingernails.

Jamora’s reaction was sparked by the discussion of Tutor and ABC Pres. Jovito Achas.

Jamora reportedly rushed to Tutor who was caught off guarded and was clawed on his left ear.

After the incident, Kag. Jamora then slammed the glass, kicked the cubicles and pointed a finger against Tutor and shouted invectives at him before picking  logbook and tried to throw it to Tutor, an extract of the police blotter said.

However, other SB members prevented Jamora from doing so including Vice Mayor Dodong Virtudes.
