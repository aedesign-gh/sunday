An alliance supporting the establishment of a revolutionary government called by Pres. Duterte was formed here last week in time for the one time, big time mass movement on Nov. 30.

Reports exclusively gathered by the Bohol Sunday News revealed that the alliance is composed of the key members of KilusangPagbabago (KP) in Bohol, Young Officers Union (YOU) and the Guardians mostly identified with Sen. Gregorio Honasan.

The report added that the federalism movement in Bohol is now part of the National Network for Revolutionary Government (Net Rev)

The alliance will be coming out with a show of force anytime next week and will be featured during the live streaming during the mass movements in the major cities of Manila, Cebu and Davao on Thursday.

The group behind the formation of a revolutionary government is eyeing to mobilize by live streaming at least 5,000 viewers.

Although the President mellowed down in his call for the establishment of a revolutionary government recently, the alliance is moving outside of the government institution.

Sources within the alliance said the revolutionary government is an extra-constitutional mobilization of people outside of government. 

It will pave the way for the creation of a new constitution that provides for a federal system. 
If Pres. Duterte declares a revolutionary government, all elected positions in the government will be considered vacant and will filled up with officers-in-charge.
