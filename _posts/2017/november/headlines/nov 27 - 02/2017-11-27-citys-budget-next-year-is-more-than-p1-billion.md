The city government annual budget next year stands more than P1 billion as approved by the SangguniangPanlungsod last week. 

Sponsored by City Councilor Adam RelsonJala who chairs the committee on appropriation and accounts, the city sanggunian approved the annual budget of P1, 046,003,157.00.

Jala said the budget will cover priority initiatives for next year such as the concreting of roads, specifically the interior barangay roads, phase 7 of the street lighting facilities which will be installed along V.P. Inting beginning at NFA passing through Mansasa-Dampas to Toledo Street up to Petron Gasoline Station.

The budget will also finance the 2nd phase construction of the Tagbilaran City College, 3rd phase construction of the PaglaumCenter, 1st phase construction of the City Engineering Office and second phase of the landscaping of the city hall.

Others inclclude the renovation of Manga market, rehabilitation of pump houses, pumping stations and distribution lines, purchase of additional CCTVs cameras and purchase of ambulance. 

The city government is in continuous partnership with USAID-SURGE through which it aims to accomplish and effect progressive changes in its public service delivery. 

City Vice-Mayor Jose Antonio S. Velosotogether with Jala and Budget Officer MarysolPerocho led a series of budget hearings with the different department heads of the city government’s various offices to analyze the soundness of each department’s budget allocation. 

The expenditure program distribution by sector lists the general public services as having the highest allocation with P558.28 M, followed by the Economic Services with P244.62 million, social services and welfare with P131.05 million, health, nutrition and population with P70.02 million, and the calamity reserve with P42.06 million. 

The economic enterprise performed well this year with net income amounting to almost P34 million as of October this year. 

Unlike last year where it was subsidized with P13.3 million pesos for its operational expenses. 

The city government  is not fully dependent on its Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) pegged at P390.56 million as the amount accounts only 38% of the total annual budget for 2018. 

PrimitivaOntong,revenue generation consultant said this is a strong indication that the city’s collection is more than enough to cover its operational expenditures.

City Mayor Baba Yap is optimistic that the 2018 Annual Budget will further reinforce the current excellent track of the City Government in fulfilling its objective. 

Yap is also hopeful that with the positive trend of the city government’s revenue collections, posting an increase from the previous years, the city will again exceed its targeted revenues and will perform even stronger for 2018. (with reports from Jeanette Laila Busano, City Media Bureau)
