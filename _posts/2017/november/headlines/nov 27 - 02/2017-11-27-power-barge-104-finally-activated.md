POWER BARGE 104 moored in Tapal port, Ubay taken during the inspection of Rep. Aris C. Aumentado last month.

UBAY.- Power barge 104 moored in Barangay Tapal this town finally became operational during the switch on ceremony last Friday after it was synchronized to the power system in the province.

The switch-on ceremony of circuit breaker for Power Barge 104 was done one after the other by Engr. Cesar Villegas, VP for Business Development and Commercial Operations of Salcon Power Corporation (SPC); Engr. Virgilio P. Sanchez, Head, NGCP Visayas Operations and Maintenance Gov. Edgar M. Chatto.

Ubay Vice-Mayor Nelson Uy, Barangay Captains Teodulo S. Cadorniga and Danilo Valmoria of Barangays Imelda and Tapal, respectively, BOHECO II General Manager Engr. Eugene R. Tan, BOHECO I General Manager Engr. Dino Nicolas T. Roxas, representatives from BLCI and the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) and NGCP personnel witnesses the ceremony.

Power Barge 104 is a substantial addition to the Bohol Diesel Power Plant (BDPP) that can serve local demand during abnormal times, though not fully, thus providing a significant relief.

The experiences from ‘Yolanda’, the host of typhoons which also affected power lines that transport electricity from Ormoc to Southern Leyte and the most recent, the July 6 earthquake, speak of  homes, businesses catering to the thriving tourism industry, offices and other industries being severely affected as the absence of power supply would last days and weeks.

NGCP supports efforts to put in place more stable and more reliable power in Bohol Island, and the construction of this 69kV tie line to Power Barge 104 of SPC Power Corporation is a testament, Sanchez reiterated.

In the blueprint is another project, the Cebu-Bohol interconnection, which will serve as an additional power supply route to Bohol, another manifestation of NGCP’s solid backing of Bohol’s economic goals. 
The project will be realized within the set timeline with the cooperation of the people and leaders of the province, he added.

Sanchez reaffirmed NGCP’s assurance to Gov. Chatto and the Boholanos that their company is “committed to continuing its upgrade and expansion of its local facilities and systems in order to deliver reliable and quality power transmission services to the Island, in support of the economic roadmap of the local administration.”

For Engr. Juiseppe R. Lomaad, NGCP’s Chief Engineer for Transmission Lines, D2 for Visayas Operations and Maintenance, the earthquake led Boholanos to realize in putting up additional power lines. 

The actual switching on of Power Barge 104 is “another milestone in the energy program in the province,” said Gov. Chatto.

The power plan for Bohol is really to establish its own power plants not later than December 26, 2023.
Therefore, Chatto is appealing to BLCI, BOHECO I, and BOHECO II to finalize the term of reference so that “we can proceed with the competitive selection process (CSP) or competitive bidding process.”

However, he reiterated what he has said before that the supplier for Bohol’s power will already be very, very cost efficient, already be reliable, and most of all, consistent with the province’s sustainable development vision considering the environmental impact that should also be put into consideration.

He stated further that its purpose is only to connect the present state of the lack of power to the future state of sufficiency in power when the Cebu interconnection will already be completed by NGCP in 2020 or 2021.

In the Bohol Energy Development Advisory Group (BEDAG) meeting last Thursday, everybody agreed to look into, whether or not, Bohol would still add additional bridging solutions. 

This is because the power situation now has still a gap even if we already have the barge. 

On Dec. 2, of which the pre-scheduled blackout would most probably be during the day, the power demand would be lower. 

Hopefully, and getting our fingers crossed, the power barge, the BDPP in Dampas, and the hydro powers can supply a substantial portion of the power supply of Bohol. 

Power Barge 104 will be standing by in Bohol, which would only be used when needed, but paying only for what was consumed; meaning, no standby fees to be paid for power that has not been used. 

The Office of the Governor has received a resolution from LGU-Ubay asking Gov. Chatto to intervene on behalf of the BEDAG, that is, to put the power barge in Ubay, the original plan of which was to put it in Loon. 

After Thursday’s deliberations and considering the strategic location of Ubay, and with BLCI and BOHECO I near Tagbilaran, it was then concurred by all, NGCP, BOHECO I, BOHECO II and BLCI, that SPC Power Barge 104 is to put on a permanent standby in Ubay. 

Engr. Cesar Villegas, VP for Business Development and Commercial Operations of SPC described the switching on as “inspirational.” 

Villegas reminisced about the July 6 Leyte earthquake and he attested that “your very energetic, very aggressive, very dynamic governor, who was out of the country then, made things possible. Power returned to Tagbilaran the following day.”(with reports from Janet Lim Villarojo/PGBh/EDCom)
