AGRIDOC is a season long training under the Agriculture Training Institute (ATI)that runs from July to November this year for Region VII. 

Generally, it aims to improve promotion and delivery of extension services by enhancing the capability of the next generation of rice extension professionals.

The training was divided into six (6) modules that were creatively titled as Be Transformed, AgRICool, AgRiSurvivors, PalaYcheck and PalaYamanan v2.0, Rise with Rice, and Be RICEponsible. The activities includes lectures, workshops,on-site visits, demonstration, immersion and the crafting of project proposal and defense.

Agridoc is one of the component of the Improving Technology Promotion and Delivery through Capacity Enhancement of Next-Gen Rice Extension Professionals and other Intermediaries (IPaD) project. 

IPaD is an initiated program of the Department of Agriculture through the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI) and Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) in partnership with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). 

One of the IPaDs major component is the development of a new breed of rice extension professionals to help meet the challenges of a more complex, challenging, and competitive rice production environment. Graduates of this program are called AgRIDOCs or agricultural development and extension officers of the community.
