31st Sunday of the Year(cycle A)
Readings:	Mal1:14b-2:2b, 8-10; 1 Thes2:7b-9, 13; Mt23:1-12

Against whom is Jesus addressing his seven terrible accusations: “Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites...”?  Logically… against the scribes and Pharisees of his time.  Not so!  The very first verse we read today tells us that Jesus is speaking “to his disciples”.  They are the one in danger of being “Pharisees”.  It is we who must feel provoked by the words of the Master.

A Pharisee, to start with, is one who occupies a chair that does not belong to him.  The book of Deuteronomy states that Moses’ successors, those who must take his place “on his chair”, those responsible for transmitting the word of God to the people, are the prophets.  The scribes and Pharisees have taken a place which is not theirs.  They have replaced the prophetic message by their precepts and laws, their pretty arguments, their rigorous interpretations.  They call “word and will of God” things that are only human prescriptions and arguments.  If today we still have something similar, if people have taken somebody else’s chair, if one substitutes human precepts for prophecy, then he is a “Pharisee”.

Jesus is not suggesting that we should follow the teachings of the Pharisees.  He continually criticizes their doctrines; so here it is as if he were saying: “Go, go after them, do as they say, you will see…”  But this verse gives us also the second characteristic of the “Pharisee”: incoherence.  He is a person who says and repeats, but never does.  Externally he is a very religious man, one who speaks beautifully of love, peace, respect for others, but then, when nobody is watching… Do we have in our communities people like this?  Is there somebody who on Sundays rushes to be the first in the church, sits in the front pew, comes up with a beautiful suggestions and advice for the others, but once back at home offends and even beats his wife, is selfish, speaks evil of others, does not help anybody?  If there is somebody like this, then he is a “Pharisee”.

The third characteristic of the “Pharisees” is that of tying up heavy burdens and laying them on men’s shoulders.  They are people who invent a religion full of countless little laws and prescriptions, the observance of which they say should make us feel at peace with God.  In reality all they do is to make life impossible, cause anxiety, deprive us of joy and freedom.  In another part of the gospel Jesus invites his disciples to free themselves from this burden that hinders people from leading a happy and free life, a life of children of God.  Don’t we at times still come across people who try to burden others with “absurd and impossible loads”?

The fourth characteristic of the “Pharisees” is exhibitionism: they want people to know that they are different from the others.  And to get this they make use of “tricks”: they dress in a particular way, stick on certain badges; when they pray they make sure all know it, if they do anything good the “blow their trumpet”, in short they are like people who want to have the TV cameras always focused on them everywhere.  Are we sure that this desire to show off has disappeared?  Aren’t we very pleased when we hear “our group”, “our community, or other institutions being praised?  Have all the Christian communities really learnt to do good without pretending that everybody should know it?

Christianity is not a show off kind of religiosity.  Instead it is focused more on humble service and becoming coherent in words and deeds.
