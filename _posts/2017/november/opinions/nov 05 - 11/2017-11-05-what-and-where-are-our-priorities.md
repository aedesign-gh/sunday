For Boholanos who don’t travel much within the province of Bohol, news of bridges being constructed or repaired, roads being paved or re-blocked are pleasant to the ears.  It gives assurance to the listeners or readers of the news that their government is a caring government.  But to those who travel a lot either by driving their own vehicle or just commuting, the question that they ask upon reading or hearing the news is “What and where the priorities of government are?”

Time and again I have written in this column about the misplaced, am not saying wrong, priorities of government when it comes to road infrastructure.  But up to now I have not received an acceptable answer direct to this column or in any forum. So here I am asking again.  What and where are the priorities of government in road infrastructure?  This time I will add, “What has happened to the bottom-up budgeting or BUB?”

There is no argument against government allocating funds for the repair of bridges that pose danger to the safety of the public or repaving or re-blocking of potholed highways and roads.  But need they be done first compared to portions of the national highway that are almost unpassable.

We have seen the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) working to correct road grades or correct blind curves like that in Balilihan-Catigbian portion of the national highway.  Fine they need to be done.  But why can’t a 20 meters potholed portion of the same highway right at the poblacion of Catigbian be left unattended for so long a time already so much so that more potholes are added every day?  Don’t these potholes pose danger to the safety of vehicles and pedestrians alike?  Or is it because the “project” is too small it won’t make contractors and DPWH officials happy?

We have seen portions of the national highways in Bohol still in perfect condition but re-blocking works were done because “they have beenlisted in the road inventory where sub-base failures have been detected.”  Wow they have seen sub-base failure in those portions of the highway but they have not seen surface failure in those potholed portions that need immediate intervention.

This situation is no different in Tagbilaran City.  We are happy to see concreting works being done in many city streets even in those with less traffic.  But city hall engineers and officials did not see the dilapidated parking area between the Central Public Market and the Island City Mall (ICM).Unless that parking area is not the responsibility of the city government, I am tempted to describe our city officials as looking only where they want to see and avoid those that they don’t.

This last quarter of the year is for deliberation of annual budgets of national and local governments.  It is time to look more thoroughly on where funds go to. Deliberation should not only be limited to the halls of conference rooms and legislative councils.  Annual Investment Plans and the itemized budgets should be validated on site especially if these pertain to infrastructure programs, projects and activities (PPAs).  BUB means the budgeting process must start from the bottom – from the very level who knows what they need and get those needs funded.

It is time the public put to good use and practice their right to participate in governance.
