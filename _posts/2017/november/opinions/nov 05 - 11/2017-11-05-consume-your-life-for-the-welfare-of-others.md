The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Nov. 5, 2017-Sunday) Mark 12:18-27- If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife:
Your ultimate task in heaven is to pray unceasingly. You will worship God 24 hours and because of this truth; you need to practice this while you have still time to do it by activating your faith on this earth. You are just living temporary and soon; you will go to eternity. Before it happens, have a constant training on how to be saved. Your daily existence is given to you for a great reason for you to do. Do the right things consistently because this is the absolute key to inherit the kingdom of the living God.  From this earth you will be raised to heaven if God can see that you are ready and prepared very well.
 
The reason why you are living too long on this earth is not an accident but he has a purposed for you to repent and change. God doesn’t want to lose you after this life. He wants you to be with him in eternal life without end. Use your time exactly and wisely because every day is a new day for you to do the will of the living God. He wants you to do a certain thing with a big love. He wants you to connect to him by calling him always. The more you are connected to God; the more you have the big chance to be with him in Paradise. Ephesians 5:15-16”Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. Spend your life with a great accomplishment in life. Consume your life for the welfare of others. Look at a pencil; although it is consumed when it is used but it has a legacy to leave forever.
