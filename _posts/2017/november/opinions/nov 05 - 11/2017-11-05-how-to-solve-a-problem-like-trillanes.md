When we started to write about Sen. Antonio Trillanes III, Chinky C. Fuentes, wife of kumpadreChito A. Fuentes, came up with a post in her Facebook account about the no. 1critic of Pres. Duterte (after Sen. Leila Delima was incarcerated).

Read her ranting against Trillanes:

“I am not a vindictive person. In fact, ingnonnakosaakongbanangamailadrakokaybisanmagyawyawkougtaman, mobigayragihaponko. Perokinisi #TRILLANES ba. 

Ambotna lang. He accuses the Dutertes and other government officials, call them names, make fun of them, challenge them without any sense and make stories about them. 

Perougmabawsan, mo-ijak! File a case here, file a case there. Believe me, I pray hard for him and I pray for myself too kaysukonajudkokaayoaniniya. 

Gusto najudkomoingonsaatongPresident ngapwedeba do what you can to remove him from the Senate? Wala man gihaponnahatagngakaayohansaatongnasod. Okay ra ma-critical saPresidenteugubang officials basta:

1. Naay sense and concrete evidence and 
2. Naapudgibuhat para sakaayohansakatawhan. Sapagkatinuod, gasamok-samokra.Sayangkaayoang position bangasiyaang nag-occupy. 

It could have been given to someone who loves our country and the Filipino people. Kiniiyang passion gipakitauggigamit pa niniyapagtabang, mouswag ta.

How about magyawyawsiyasamganangurakotsakwartasa Yolanda? Pwedepudmo file siyaug cases samganaasa government nga involved sa drugs and other crimes. 

Motabangsiyasamga victims sa drug addicts. Motabangsiyaug encourage saatong troops, being a soldier himself, maybe make a law that would give more benefits to our armed forces. 

Pwedesiyamotabangsamgana-injured sa war, rehabilitation samarawi, etc. Kadaghanniyagmahimo. And he can still criticize the president while doing all these things. 

Para nakookeyra.Bastakaynaaynatabangan. But he chose to be evil. Sorry to say that. 

Kinsadirisaakong friends sa Facebook mibotarniya? Sorry ha? But I blame you for giving us a problem like Trillanes.”

All we can say to herantings is: Amen.
