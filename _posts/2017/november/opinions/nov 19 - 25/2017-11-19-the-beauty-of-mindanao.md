Savouring the beauty of Mindanao 
(First of Two Parts)

Last week we took an emergency leave of absence from our press work in order to proceed to Mindanao to attend the wake and burial of our elder brother, Rene who died early dawn last Nov. 7 in Mabini, Malangas, ZamboangaSibugay. 

We have not visited the place where we spend our childhood for almost a decade.
It took Rene’s death to compel us to visit the place which is dearest to our heart.

We have to compel almost everybody in the family to sojourn with us in our trip down memory lane brining with us our bat mobile from this city to Plaridel town in Misamis Occidental by boat with a short stopover in Siquijor.

Our commander-in-chief took advantage of the stopover and require us to proceed briefly to Siquijor at midnight before we departed to Plaridel.

When we arrived at Plaridel in the following morning, we immediately proceeded to Ozamis City where we took our brunch before we proceeded by land to Pagadian City.

We have a short stopover in Pagadian to join forces with other family members coming from Davao City who also brought with them a Trailblazer passing through Boda then to Cagayan de Oro City then to Iligan and picked up another family member there. 

They decided to have convoy with us in travelling from Pagadian City down to Buug, ZamboangaSibugay after lunch then to Diplahan down to Malangas.

It took more than a half-day trip from Plaridel to Malangas although we make several stopovers. That is the comfort if we bring a vehicle as we can easily address the call of nature.

Our kids find the trip a very long trip and we just rely on the GPS to follow the road and depend upon my eldest son who is based in Cebu City to keep track on us through the Google.

Except for the Philippine Coast Guard in Plaridel port, we have not seen any uniformed soldier on our way to Malangas.

At around 5 o’clock in the afternoon the other Sunday, we were already at the place where we grew up and the remains of our late brother, Rene, greeted us.

On the second part of this series, join us as we explore once again the beauty of Mindanao, its food and culture, sans the Martial Law. (To be continued)
