“Got Talent” is a British talent show television format conceived and owned by Simon Cowell's SYCOtvcompany. A pilot was made in the United Kingdom in 2005, hosted by Paul O'Grady, but after O'Grady's split with ITV, the series was postponed, resulting in NBC's America's Got Talent – the first full series of the format.  It has spawned spin-offs in over 58 countries (as of April 2014), in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by FremantleMedia of the Idol and The X Factor formats. Unlike those shows, Got Talent showcases several artistic disciplines in addition to singing. In April 2014, the format was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by the Guinness World Records.  Many people around the world join the Got Talent show with their hopes and aspirations of fulfilling their dreams for stardom or simply for recognition.

The Gospel today speaks of the parable of the talents.  But the talents mention in the parable is not that what we commonly understood as such like that of the Got Talent shows.  Moreover, it speaks of a much deeper meaning.  But first we must understand the meaning of the other elements.

The man of the parable is a very rich man from the Orient.  A talent is a large sum: it is equivalent to the salary of a laborer over a period of twenty years.

The rich master is Christ, who before leaving this world to enter the glory of the Father, has entrusted all his “goods” (or talents) to his disciples.  The waiting time, during which the talents have to be put to good use to produce fruits is the period that goes from Easter to the return of Christ at the end of time.  It is thus the time of the Church.  The servants are all the members of the Christian communities.  And what is the exact meaning of the talents, the riches entrusted to us?  It is all that Jesus gave us: first of all his Gospel, his message of salvation, then Baptism, the Eucharist and all the other sacraments, the power to heal, to console, his love for the poor, for the suffering, etc.  The talents correspond to the various ministries exercised in our communities.

The Christian community organizes its life; it grows, it develops, it performs a profound transformation in the world where its Lord is no longer visibly present.  He has left this world after entrusting all the goods and powers he had.  It is now up to his disciples to act in such a way that what he has entrusted to them may produce abundant fruit.  But how?  Everyone has to take responsibility for some part of this wealth with announcing the word of God; another will be given the task of preparing the people for baptism; others may help the young couples to prepare for marriage, others will care for the poor, others will try to reconcile the members of the community that might have had misunderstandings, others still will organize the liturgical celebrations and singing, etc.  No single treasure of Christ should be allowed to remain unused.

If somebody does not feel like doing his service as asked of him (either because he does not feel prepared for it, or because he has not time, or because he is having a difficult time in life) what should he do?  Simple: he should not go on holding on to a job or to a place of responsibility.  He must hand over his ministry to the “bank”, that is, to the community, so that his share of service may be entrusted to somebody else who can do it faithfully, because all the ministries must be carried out.

What are the “talents” distributed among the members of our community?  What is the ministry entrusted to each one?  Are they yielding fruit, or have some of them been buried or yield very little?  So, who is the main character of the parable?  Certainly the third servant, the one who got scared.  The words that his master uses to reproach are the main teaching: the only unacceptable behavior is doing nothing.
