Of flooded streets and traffic lights

When do we know that a certain portion of the land is prone to flooding?  After each heavy rain.  And when do we know that certain road sections and intersections need traffic lights? After a study of traffic flow has been made. Do we have inspection of flooded areas after each heavy rain in Tagbilaran City? And has there been a study of traffic flow in Tagbilaran City?  These I don’t have the answers anymore.

Why do I ask these questions?  Because for days and weeks now, Tagbilaranons have observed that some portions of the city, including a city street, have become little lakes and nothing is being done about them. And that at certain hours of the day and night traffic lights installed in the city have caused traffic build up rather than facilitate ease of traffic flow.

I can’t memorize all the names of the streets in Tagbilaran City but that street that intersects Tamblot St. near former Mayor Joe Torralba’s residence has been flooded knee deep for weeks now but nothing has been done by the City Engineers office to drain it and it is causing a lot of bother to motorists and residents in that area besides it becoming a health hazard.

What happens to the drainage system of Tagbilaran City?  During heavy rains, run off waters flood the streets because the drainage canals have become plugged with soil and solid wastes causing run off waters to overflow to the streets.  The one particularly at J.A. Clarin Avenue overflows every time it rains but city engineers don’t see it because it is better to just curl inside one’s office during heavy rains.

When supervisors don’t supervise, that’s when the problem starts.

Tagbilaranons are happy that traffic lights have been installed, even if they don’t function all the time, in several strategic areas.  But motorists are sad that these traffic lights are sometimes the cause of traffic unnecessary build up in the city.

And thus they ask what variables were made part of the study of the traffic flow in the city that were the basis of the installation of the traffic lights?  For example, why would the J.A. Clarin-Miguel Parras Street need a traffic light more than the intersection at the J.A. Clarin and CP Garcia East Road? And why should motor vehicles going through J.A. Clarin be made to stop on red light for 72 seconds when there are only a few vehicles crossing it on Miguel Parras St.?  How were the timing for change of traffic lights determined?

And what about the traffic light installed at the intersection of CPG North Road and Airport Road?  For several days last week, the traffic lights did not work and traffic just flowed freely and smoothly without any traffic build up on any side and direction.   When the lights worked again this week, traffic build up worsened.

After 8 o’clock at night, motorists curse when they are forced to stop by the red light for 103 seconds seeing that there are no vehicles on the other side of the intersection.  
What am I saying here?  That the locations of the traffic lights were not well studied and that the volume of traffic at certain hours of the day and night were not considered in setting the duration of the stop and go lights.

While it is admitted that the volume of vehicular traffic has increased in Tagbilaran City, it has not come to an extent where traffic is still heavy after 8 o’clock in the evening.  In this case traffic lights could be switched to just blinking yellow light.  Or better still a sensor be installed so that the duration of the traffic lights could adopt to the presence of vehicles on the road.
