Last week, we went to Inambacan Falls in Antequera town. The owner of the land where the falls is situated who served as the caretaker of his ancestral estate wailed that the cave where the water of the fall comes out is being looted by burglars. He said the pristine chalk-while stalactites and stalagmites that for years had been inside the cave were being pried off and carted away by robbers.

The rock formation is a sight to behold, the caretaker said. It is one of the attraction of Inambacan Falls which will soon be develop by the local government of Antequera which reportedly had already a budget for its development to start next year.

Stalactites look like rock daggers hanging down from the roof of caves while stalagmites are the ones protruding from cave floors. They are rock formation composed of calcium carbonate shaped by timethrough the dripping of water. Through the years the stalactites and stalagmites meet at the middle to form a grotesque looking pillar. 

The Inambacan Cave stalactites and stalagmites were virginal white like captured sunlight, the caretaker said, unlike the stalactites of Padhan Cave in Maribojoc which were blackened by the soot of coconut frond torch. The caretaker lamented the loss of the rock formations.

Wealthy stone collectors are turning their eyes on stalactites and stalagmites nowadays. They pride themselves to have one as a decor inside their expensive houses for the envy of their also well-to-do guests. The unique and grotesque looking stalactite commands the higher price. These rock formations can be had at antique shops or can be stolen to order. This is a form of desecration of nature.

As of this writing a large mountain in Antequera was split open wide to pave a road straight directly to an old sturdy steel bridge constructed during the American time. The project is on a road going to barangay Tupas. It is a desecration of nature, but it will make the approach to the bridge a peace of mind and safe. Just like on the way to San Isidro town a whole mountainside came down by blasting to pave a way for a safe approach to the bridge. (Old people of San Isidro still love to call their town its old name of Agbunan.)

In order that nature could not be desecrated,why not bore down a tunnel under the mountain? In Bulacan province in Luzon, they built elevated roads so that ricefields could not be desecrated. In Ilocos Norte they had also elevated roads so that the contours of the mountain could not be altered or mutilated.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Nature heals itself.
