The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Nov. 26, 2017-Sunday)John 21:1-14” They said to him, "We will also come with you." They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing. But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. So Jesus said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish, do you?" They answered Him, "No." And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch." So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.

We can notice that some Jesus disciples went back to their original occupations being fishers. What was the reason of this event? Because of their disappointments and frustrations with the death of their master- Jesus, they gave up their interest to follow the footsteps of Jesus to catch the souls of the people. Sometimes we have the same mentality with these disciples since we are quitting in some of our assignments and doings. We are good at the start but not until the end. 

We are “ningaskugon” many times. This kind of grass grows rapidly but dies abruptly. Take note: quitter never wins and winner never quits. My advice; finish the jobs that you have started most especially if that is God instruction for your life on this earth. Do not quit along the way but persevere until your last breath. Matthew 24:13"But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.

On the other hand, the disciples got nothing from their fishing because they did it by their own capacity. The reason for this was; they misunderstood Jesus that was no longer with them. They had forsaken by Jesus although not. It was only their presumptions about Jesus whom they believed and trusted so much. 

This means that if we will do a certain thing alone, we have nothing unless God intervenes. John 15:5”I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. The good news: when Jesus was with them, they got more than enough fishes. Therefore, invite God in all your endeavours to make it more fruitful.
