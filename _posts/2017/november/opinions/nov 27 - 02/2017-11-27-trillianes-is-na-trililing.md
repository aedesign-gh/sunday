Lately, Senator AntonioTrillianes IV suggested that the social media accounts of all supporters of Pres. Rodrigo R. Duterte are to be deactivated.

The suggestion of Trillianes earned him a moniker of trililing, a sarcastic Bisayan word which means a person who has become insane. 

The critics of Trililing commented that is what he got of being so antagonistic to Pres. Duterte. His heart is full of anger and hatred towards the president that critics say some bolts in his head had turned loose.

Trililing is also a sarcastic word which means a man who has a heart which beats lust for another man. Critics say that the mouth of Trililing which keep on harping against the President is a mouth of a trililing. The character of Trililing who is a perfectionist and an “intriguero” manifest of a woman’s heart.

Trililing relishes the thought that Filipinos like and love his being an “intriguero”. On the contrary many hated him for his so critical to the government. Let him run for president, critics say, if he ever won. When he went to America last week only five people, perhaps the same feather as his, came to see him.

If Trililing had been an Iraqi during the time of Saddam Husain, he had long been shot in the head personally by Saddam. Thanks we have a president like Duterte who takes in stride Trililing’s diatribes. Trililing is abusing the freedom of speech. 

Last Monday Cabinet Sec.LeoncioEvasco, former town mayor of Maribojoc, met the trainees and parents of Escuela Taller at the Balayni San Vicente. The participants will be trained to carve stones and wood for the restoration of the parish church which was leveled to the ground by the Oct. 15, 2013 7.2 M earthquake. He was happy that he saw some drug users to be among the trainees. He asked them to be responsible persons to obey their parents, supervisors on their jobs, respect their fellow trainees and the president of the country so that they will not resort to be drug users again.

On the same occasion, he disclosed that the ancientMaribojoc wharf which was the hub of commerce and port of entry from Mindanao before World War II will be made the biggest and state-of-the-art container port in Bohol in the near future.  It has a budget of a whooping P500 B.
