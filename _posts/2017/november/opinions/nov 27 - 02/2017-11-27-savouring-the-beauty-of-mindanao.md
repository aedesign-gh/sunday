(Conclusion)

From the moment we set our feet in Plaridel town up to Mabini, Malangas, ZamboangaSibugay, we have not seen any uniformed men except the Philippine Coast Guard personnel who guided us as we embark our vehicle from Lite Ferries 15.

Though we passed some PNP checkpoints but there was no inspection whatsoever. 

By the way the absence of the anti-carnapping clearance has made out trip to the Land of Promise just like a walk in the part as we brought along our family vehicle to and from Mindanao.

In other words, we have not felt the existence of Martial Law in Mindanao all throughout our travel.
After our arrival in Mabini, Malangas, ZamboangaSibugay, we want to impress to our children how cheap is the price of fish in the place where we spent our childhood.

The following morning, fish sellers aboard motorcycles with an improvised  sound system started to pass by in our place and shouted the price per kilo of fish ranging from P40, P50 and P80.

The variety of fish includes andohaw, tamarong etc. Salimbagon is quite high at P100 per kilo.

Our children were quite mesmerized because they know for fact how much the price of fish is in Tagbilaran City.

Not contented, we travelled to Siay and Monching, Kabasalan and brought dried fish ranging from P140 per kilo for danggit, big sliced dried fish is P180 per kilo.

We passed by Diplahan town, which serves as the crossing between Ipil and Malangas and noticed that the price of rice ranges from P30 to P45 only. Nothing is	This is the beauty of Mindanao. The abundance of food supply and its corresponding cheap price.

Due to the time constraints of our stay there, we have to live fast in order to catch up the trip back to Bohol.

In our way back, we have to refuel our vehicle and noticed that the price of diesel in ZamboangaSibugay up to Ozamiz City ranges from P34 to P35 per liter which is lower than our diesel price here in the city.

One of our kids said that it is better to work here in the Visayas and send their income to Mindanao in order to maximize the expenses of their money.

Back here in the city, one can only heave in silence our cartelized price of fish and fuel products.
