Seven months ago I got really sick after eating seafood, chicken and meat. I decided to become a vegetarian. I thought about enjoying the 20% discounts for senior citizens in less than ten years from today; hence, the decision. God bless my hopes to serve more with Christian love. I’m not imposing my own ideas on anyone, just sharing.

Speaking of self-transformation, the top tennis athletes in the world are great examples of efforts to make changes in one’s self. Rafael Nadal, Juan Martin Del Potro, Roger Federer, they all underwent various surgeries in different parts of their bodies, particularly their wrists and legs. But look at them now, they are back in good shape and playing almost perfect tennis. It is even more amazing to see that they remain humble in the midst of their greatness.

At our SangguniangPanlalawigan, we also have Atty. Tommy Abapo who has served our people in various capacities as provincial legislator, administrator, and law dean. Dr. PediongJala who has served long years as educator and schools division superintendent and Vice Gov.DioningBalite, the only Boholano lawyer-educator who has taken his schools to other provinces. They have crossed-swords with various illnesses and the wear and tear of aging. But look at them now, they are still among the top performers at our provincial legislature. Gov. Edgar Chatto himself, a person with disability, after having been a polio victim at a young age, has metamorphosed into a multi-awarded political leader.

We all have weaknesses and character flaws that we have to wrestle with in this life. But exemplary beings have shown that there is always a chance for us to make improvements here and there. Perhaps, you have been unduly influencing people, even children, by speaking with cuss words. If you are a leader, and you may have given the wrong signal to your people that killing is okay. There is still a chance to change all that. It can be done while we are still breathing.

This week’s quote comes from Timothy Conway: “Mahatma Gandhi once said that ‘Those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means’.The same goes for ecology and economics. A deep spirituality cannot abandon these domains to confused human beings lacking vision or empathy”.
