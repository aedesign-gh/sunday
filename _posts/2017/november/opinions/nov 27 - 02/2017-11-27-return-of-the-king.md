Return of the King

Christ, the King Sunday (cycle A)
Readings:  Ez34:11-12, 15-17; 1 Cor 15:20-26; Mt 25:31-46

The third part of J.R. Tolkien’s book The Lord of the Rings was titled The Return of the King.  It is about Middle Earth which had been inflicted by the evil forces of Sauron.  The world of men whose capital in Gondor had been left without a king and they are all scattered because they were without a leader.  But there was a prophecy that rightful heir of the last king will return and he will defeat Sauron.  This prophesized king is Aragorn, one of the members of the Fellowship of the Ring.  At the end of the book Aragorn defeated Sauron and he was crowned the king of Gondor and of the world of men.

In this last Sunday of the liturgical year we celebrate the Solemnity of Christ the King and the theme of our readings directs us to the return of the true king.

In the first reading, we heard the prophecy of Ezekiel.  Looking over all the disasters that have struck his people, he compares Israel to a flock with all the sheep scattered and without a shepherd and he proclaims a message of salvation.

God does not promise to send other kings, but he says that he himself will lead his flock, he will gather them once again from all places where they were scattered “during the days of mist and darkness” and will lead them once again to grazing grounds of the mountains of Israel.  Addressing his flock, God says: “I will judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and he-goats”.  This is a clear promise that he will intervene in favor of the oppressed, the poor and the exploited.

In our Gospel, we heard Christ giving us a picture of what will happen when we comes again.  We profess in our faith that he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end.  Our gospel portrays that prophecy of Ezekiel when Christ will return and he will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.

We all know the point of the story.  Those who helped the needy will be the one to join in Christ’s glory.

And so we ask ourselves: When was the last time we helped someone who needed help?  When was the last time we helped the very least of our brothers and sisters?  When was the last time we carried out some works of mercy?

In our family, in our clusters, in our Trinities, in our parish, when was the last time we volunteered to help those who needed most?  Have we opened our hearts to the poor, the lonely, the needy, regardless of who they are and where they live?

Today’s message is so important because it concerns what we will be judged on at the end of our lives.  We will be judged on how well we served Christ the King in the least important among us.

There was a story of a king who did not have an heir.  So he invited every man in his kingdom and from them he can choose who would inherit his crown.  He disguised himself as a beggar and stayed along the road.  Most of those who are interested of the crown mistreated the disguised king therefore they were not chosen.  But there was one who helped him with all that he had.  Later the beggar revealed to him that he was the king and that he passed the test.
