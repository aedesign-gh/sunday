Last week the hot issue in Panglao was the construction of the Ivy Wall Resort and Hotel in what was once the Playa Blanca at the beach zone of Brgy. Danao in Panglao.  The construction of the 12-storey building of DataLand Inc. on a 1,637 sqm. beach zone caught the attention of other resort owners and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Panglao because of its possible negative impact on the environment.  They raised the issue direct to Mayor Nila Montero of Panglao, who called an executive-legislative meeting to thresh out the issue.  After the meeting, a consensus was reached to allow the construction of the building while certain “grey areas” surrounding the height limitations are being threshed out.

So has the issue been resolved just because DataLand Inc. was able to secure a height clearance from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines to construct a 12-storey building?  I don’t think so.  CAAP’s consideration for issuing the height clearance is only safety. But the Panglao Island Tourism Estate Guidelines that was adopted in toto by the municipal government of Panglao under its Municipal Ordinance No. 5 series of 2013, otherwise known as the Municipal Zoning Ordinance of Panglao has other consideration besides safety.

The ordinance is clear about the development in the beach zone – that is the area from the edge of the 20 meter easement or salvage zone up to 100 meters inland. For the first 50 meters of this beach zone measured from the easement, only 15 meters height limit or three-storey building can be constructed. And in the next 50 meters of the 100 meters beach zone, only five-storey buildings can be constructed.

If Ivy Wall Resort and Hotel has only 1,637 sqm. area in the beach zone, the building cannot extend beyond 50 meters and therefore can only be limited to a three-storey building and not even five (5) stories.  So how come it was issued a building permit for 12 stories?  It is clear that it is not the height limit rule of CAAP that governs the height of buildings in the beach zone but the objectives of the development guidelines as set in the Zoning Ordinance. 

In this case the height clearance issued by CAAP is only incidental as the location is no longer within the vicinity if the Panglao Airport.  For all it cares, CAAP can issue even for a 100-storey building as long as its location is not within the vicinity of the airport as to endanger the safety of the planes landing and taking off.

May be the Executive-Legislative meeting misunderstood the meaning of the statement of the Zoning Ordinance on the height restrictions of buildings on the beach zone that says “This height limit does not apply to areas set by height restrictions covered by the Air Transportation Office within the airport  vicinity.” (The Air Transportation Office is now Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines).  The word “does not apply” here refers to the five stories in the next 50 meters because the height restrictions set by CAAP for buildings within the airport vicinity is even lower than three stories. It means if the next 50 meters of the beach zone is within the airport vicinity, the five stories cannot be allowed.

Again had the municipality of Panglao referred first the plans of the Ivy Wall Resort and Hotel to the Review and Development Committee (REDCOM) of the Panglao Island Tourism Estate which it used to
do with the plans of other investors, this problem would not have occurred.  REDCOM would have seen to it that the plans are compliant with the development guidelines of the Zoning Ordinance.
